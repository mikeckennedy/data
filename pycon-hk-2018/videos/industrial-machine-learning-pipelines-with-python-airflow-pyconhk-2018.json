  "description": "This talk will provide a practical deep dive on how to build\nindustry-ready machine learning and data pipelines in Python. I will\ncover practical presentation that will build from the basics of Airflow,\nand show how it is possible to build scalable and distributed machine\nlearning data pipelines using a distributed architecture with a\nproducer- consumer backend using Celery. I will provide insights on some\nof the key learnings I have obtained throughout my career building\nmachine learning systems, as well as caveats and best practices\ndeploying scalable data pipelines systems in production environments.\n",
