  "description": "General principles and my experience building one\n\nThis talk will cover the standard techniques used to build chess playing\nprograms including minimax, alpha-beta search, piece valuation,\npositional valuation, iterative deepening and transposition tables. This\ntalk will assume a knowledge of python but no knowledge of chess or the\nexisting literature on how to write chess engines.\n\nI became fascinated by this topic after taking part in a competition\nwith my brothers to build the best chess program during the Christmas\nholidays 2016.",
