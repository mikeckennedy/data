  "description": "Math instruction is stuck in the 19th Century and it's in dire need of modernization. Computer programming in Python has the potential to make math class more relevant, meaningful and engaging.\n\nProgramming can not only achieve the goals we've always had for math students - to be able to think computationally and build algebraic and geometric tools to solve problems - but it can be used to explore math topics beyond the reach of traditional methods. Using Python, students can create fractals, cellular automata and 3D models to help them learn math or science topics. And it looks cool!\n\nSee http://baypiggies.net for upcoming talks.",
