  "description": "Quiz games let people test their knowledge through multi-choice\nquestions. Unfortunately, generating such questions can be very\ntime-consuming and it is typically done manually. In this talk we\nwill present a pipeline to automatically generate quiz games starting\nfrom generic knowledge (e.g. Wikipedia). The pipeline consists of the\nfollowing components: (i) a parser to retrieve text from Wikipedia\npages, (ii) a Natural Language Processing module (based on the Google\nNatural Language API) to extract information about syntax, entities\nand relations, (iii) a Natural Language Generation module to generate\ntest questions and correct answers, and finally (iv) a domain-aware\nmodule that uses domain-specific knowledge to generate wrong answers\n(i.e. distractors). Every module is written in Python and it is based\non either available libraries or Cloud services (e.g., Google Natural\nLanguage).\n\n**Prerequisites**: basic knowledge of python, minimal understanding\nof text syntactic analysis.",
