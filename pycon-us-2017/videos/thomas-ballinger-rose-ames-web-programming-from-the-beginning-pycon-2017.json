  "description": "*What\u2019s the web all about anyway? How can you make your computer talk to\nother computers with Python?*\n\nModern web frameworks such as Django and Flask are immensely powerful.\nHowever, these useful tools obscure the foundations of network\nprogramming upon which they are based, which can be very helpful to\nunderstand. So instead of building useful applications with these\nlibraries, let's experiment with sockets!\n\nAt this tutorial, a Python-flavored history of the web will be presented\nand attendees will write or modify a TCP chat client, a static site web\nserver, an HTTP client, a CGI script, and a WSGI-compliant server and\nweb application. We will learn what all those things are and how they\nfit together, bringing the architecture of modern web apps into better\nfocus.\n\nThe material will be accessible to participants with no web development\nexperience, however, they must be able to write and run Python scripts\nat the command-line. This tutorial might appeal to someone also\nattending an introductory web development tutorial, but it covers\nseparate, complementary material. Web development experience is not\nrequired but a little exposure would be helpful; for instance,\ninstalling flask and running the minimal application on the `quickstart\npage <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/quickstart/>`__. Similarly, prior\nexposure to HTML would be useful but is not necessary.\n",
