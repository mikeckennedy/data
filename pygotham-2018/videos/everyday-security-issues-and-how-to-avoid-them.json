  "description": "These days virtually all software and computer hardware is connected to the\ninternet. Ultimately the internet is a hostile place and filled with people\nthat will attempt to abuse any vulnerability for fun, profit or more\nsinister reasons. Therefore every software developer and administrator\nshould have at least a basic understanding how to develop and run code\nsecurely. After all you don\u2019t want to become the laughing stock on hacker\nnews or cause your company to loose billions in shareholder value.\n\nThis talk won\u2019t turn you into a security specialist over night, but you will\nlearn how to avoid common mistakes in your daily work. I will introduce you\nto best practices and prevalent security bugs, hilarious anecdotes and some\nreal life examples from my daily work as security engineer. The presentation\nfeatures airplanes, squirrels, ducks, and the most efficient password\ncracking method: not as brutucal as XKCD 538 and much more delicious.",
