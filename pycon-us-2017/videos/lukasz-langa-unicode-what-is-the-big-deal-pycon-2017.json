  "description": "Ever wondered why people complain that text processing is a hard\nproblem? Or why Python 3 would introduce such a big backward\nincompatibility with switching to Unicode? Wonder no more, this talk is\nfor you.\n\nIn 30 minutes I'm going to demonstrate real world text processing\nproblems and how Python 3 helps solve them. The talk is going to explain\nhow you should split your text from binary data in your application,\nwhat are sensible defaults and what are possible gotchas. All this\nsprinkled with a healthy dose of frustration by a guy whose first name\nstarts with \u0141.\n",
