  "description": "My brain is different. The regions involved in concentration, impulse\ncontrol, and inhibition are smaller than usual; Like somewhere between\n5% and 12% of adults I have ADHD. Even if you do not have the disorder\nyourself you probably work, live or know someone who does. But the world\nis not designed for people with ADHD, so to be successful I\u2019ve had to\ndevelop techniques to keep my concentration and procrastination in\ncheck.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll briefly look at what ADHD is and how it impairs not\nonly concentration but also executive function. Then we\u2019ll explore how\nchanges in the workplace can benefit not just those with ADHD, but\nanyone whose work requires creativity or extended periods of focus.\nNext, we\u2019ll look at some persistent myths about productivity, and what\nyou can do personally to increase your concentration and output without\nburning out. Then I\u2019ll present some techniques you can rollout within\nyour team to remove distractions while improving the quality of\ncommunication.\n",
