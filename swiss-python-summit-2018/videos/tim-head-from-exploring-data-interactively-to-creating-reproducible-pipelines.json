  "description": "Have you previously built a report based on some data? Worried it wouldn't work anymore when you had to re-run it six months later? Annoyed that you have to email someone to get the latest version of a plot for your slide deck?\n\nIn this interactive talk we will make a reproducible pipeline based on Jupyter notebooks and open data. I will introduce you to the Python data ecosystem highlighting tools for analysing data, creating visualisations and sharing those with your team and the public. We will start with a question, and following the path of a typical data analysis project, we will interactively explore the data, find our answers and then create a robust pipeline that allows us to re-run this analysis automatically. Finally I will show how easy it is to share what we created with others using mybinder.org.",
