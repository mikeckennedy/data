  "description": "At the Inter-University Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy (IDIA,\nwww.idia.ac.za), we are focusing on several important use-cases\nrelated to the delivery of science data products from large radio\ntelescopes, such as MeerKAT. The requirements for the hardcore\nprocessing and analysis of raw radio data has to be counter-balanced\nwith our essential need to collaborate on our science projects.\n\nWe have thus adopted the Jupyter Hub/Notebooks as the principle means of\nrunning radio astronomy workflows, pipelines and calibration scripts. We\nhave found this to be an enormously useful and powerful medium to\nprototype technical recipes, and to share lessons learned. This allows\nus to shorten the amount of time taken to develop a complex astronomical\nworkflow, and shifts the focus on the data and the processes involved in\na single, comprehensive framework.\n\nThe usage of Jupyter Notebooks is become quite popular in radio\nastronomy, and marks a distinct paradigm shift in the way that\nastronomers all over the world are collaborating on large science\nprojects.\n\nIn my talk I will focus on our usage of Jupyter Hub/Notebooks within an\nastronomical context, and some highlights related to the development of\nour astronomical computing software stack in python.\n",
