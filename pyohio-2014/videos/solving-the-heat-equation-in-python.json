  "summary": "In this talk we will solve two partial differential equations by using a\nvery small subset of numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and python. We will then\nuse a couple of techniques to generate beautiful animations of the\nsolutions we find. The listeners will see how easy it is to get serious\nwork done with only a beginner's knowledge of Python.\n",
