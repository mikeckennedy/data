  "summary": "Infinite 8-bit Platformer is a Free Software multiplayer\nuser-created-content platform video game written in Pygame. It's a bit\nlike a cross between a wiki and a game, because the players can also\ncreate and edit the levels. In this talk we will look at the development\nof the game over the last three years, including what has changed since\nPyCon 2010. We'll examine the sound, graphics, and networking\narchitecture which is built upon pygame and asyncore (PodSixNet).\n",
