  "description": "Filmed at PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nIn this tutorial we will learn Keras in ten steps (a.k.a. Jupyter Notebooks). We will warm up by learning how to create a multi layer network, and then we will go through more sophisticated topics such as implementing different types of networks (e.g. RNN, CNN), creating custom layers and discovering Keras internals. numpy proficiency and basic knowledge of Machine/Deep Learning are assumed.\n\nAbstract\nGoal of the Tutorial\n\nIntroduce main features of Keras APIs to build Neural Networks.\nLearn how to implement simple and complex Deep Neural Networks Architectures using Keras.\nDiscover Keras Implementation and Internals.\n\nNote: examples and hands-on exercises will be provided along the way.\n\nOutline (in ten Notebooks)\nMulti-layer Fully Connected Networks (and the backends)\nBottleneck features and Embeddings\nConvolutional Networks\nTransfer Learning and Fine Tuning\nResidual Networks\nRecursive Neural Networks\n[Variational] AutoEncoders and Adversarials\nMulti-Modal Networks\nCustom Layers and Optimisers\nInteractive Networks and Callbacks\nDescription\nMulti-layer Fully Connected Networks In this notebook we will learn the basic building blocks of Keras APIs to create deep neural networks. We will learn how to use the Sequential object as well as Functional and keras.backend APIs. First examples of MLP and Fully Connected Networks will be presented.",
