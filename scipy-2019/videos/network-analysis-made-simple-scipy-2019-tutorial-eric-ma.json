  "description": "Have you ever wondered about how those data scientists at Facebook and LinkedIn make friend recommendations? Or how epidemiologists track down patient zero in an outbreak? If so, then this tutorial is for you. In this tutorial, we will use a variety of datasets to help you understand the fundamentals of network thinking, with a particular focus on constructing, summarizing, and visualizing complex networks. Finally, at the end of the tutorial, allow yourself to be entertained and hopefully also enlightened by the link between applied network science and linear algebra!",
