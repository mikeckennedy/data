  "description": "Descriptors are a powerful feature of Python that can be used to augment\nor replace traditional attribute access with arbitrary behaviours. Such\nversatility makes the descriptor protocol a valuable tool for any Python\nprogrammer, yet although most of us have used descriptors, fewer have\nimplemented one.\n\nThis presentation will explain the use cases that motivate descriptors\nand how other features in Python fall short. We will then look at some\nof the descriptors that the audience may already have used (even if they\ndidn't know they were using descriptors!) This will be followed with an\nexplanation of the descriptor protocol and some implementation and usage\nexamples.\n\nI will discuss some of the finer details of descriptor implementation\nand will conclude with a look at Elk - a declarative object system\nauthored by the presenter and inspired by Perl's Moose - and the\ndescriptors that power it.\n",
