  "description": "Introducing the idea of appropriate data flows, query optimisation, and algorithm selections via the broader objective of reducing website latency.  The techniques taught are broadly applicable, not specific to websites in Django.\n\nThe goal is to open audience members eyes to the broader concepts of appropriate tech stack selection by looking briefly at HTTP/2, caching (both local and global), infrastructure stack layout,  streaming responses, aggregate requests, lazy evaluation, and some thoughts on the future of low-latency web development.",
