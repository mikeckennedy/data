  "description": "The best ML model has little business value if it operates in a vacuum. The infrastructure used at Netflix enables data-scientists to quickly deploy their model as a microservice to perform inference or integrate with other systems. We demonstrate how we leverage a Python environment, familiar to data-scientists, as well as FaaS to remove infrastructure considerations and increase productivity.",
