  "description": "Writing Python C Extensions can be daunting; you have to embrace not\njust C but Python's C API, which is huge. Not only do you have to worry\nabout just your standard malloc() and free() but now you also have to\ncontend with how CPython manages its memory.\n\nThis talk describes what you need to know to write fast ,reliable Python\nextensions in 'C'. It demonstrates some of the pitfalls you can\nencounter and some simple and robust coding patterns that you can use to\navoid them. After this talk you will be able to write Python extensions\nwith confidence.\n\nThis talk is largely based on `this\nmaterial <https://github.com/paulross/PythonExtensionPatterns>`__ and\nsome hard won industrial experience.",
