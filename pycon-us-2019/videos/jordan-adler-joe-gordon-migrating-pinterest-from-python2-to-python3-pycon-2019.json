A large, tightly coupled codebase with\nover 2 million lines of code, the Pinterest codebase contained nearly\nevery edge case that might exist in a Py2 to Py3 migration.\n\nWe'll cover our approach, gotchas, and tools, and the incredible impact\nour migration has made on infra spend and code quality.\n",
