  "description": "Whether you\u2019re an experienced educator or you\u2019re still wondering how to get started teaching others, this is a great opportunity to pick up some tips. In this talk, we\u2019ll use a new Python and Earth Science curriculum piloted at the American Museum of Natural History as a model to share best practices for teaching Python to young students. We\u2019ll discuss the value of collaborating with content experts, using online tools, and introducing coding concepts with games and hands-on activities. You\u2019ll even get to walk through an example activity yourself!",
