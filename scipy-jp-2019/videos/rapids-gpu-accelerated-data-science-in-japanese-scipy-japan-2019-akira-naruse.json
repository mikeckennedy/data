  "description": "RAPIDS has a mission to build a ridiculously fast, easy to use, open source platform that allows data scientist to explore data, train machine learning algorithms, and build applications while primarily staying in GPU memory. Our goal is that by using RAPIDS to keep tasks on the GPU, data scientists will see runtime speedups from hardware optimizations and productivity speedups from the elimination of glue code. This talk covers where the library is today, what has been done with it and where it\u2019s going, how to get started, and how you can contribute to the GPU accelerated movement.\n\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
