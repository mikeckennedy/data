  "description": "In the past recent years, the Python programming language became popular\nand widely used in many science areas, that you can notes from huge\namount of high quality **scientific** libraries available in GitHub.\nPython has already won the confidence in neuro-imaging community\n\nAnalysis of different **neuroimaging** modalities consists of\nidentifying such a complex pipeline that include supporting specific\n**MRI** data acquisition, image processing, statistics and predictive\nmodeling, and visualization of the results. **Nilearn** is a Python\npackage designed to face these challenges. It provides state-of-the-art\n**machine-learning** methods for analysis task fMRI, resting-state, or\nanathomical data. In my talk, I would like to present general purpose of\nNilearn, focusing on **functional connectivity** and **connectome**\nanalysis in resting-state fMRI.\n",
