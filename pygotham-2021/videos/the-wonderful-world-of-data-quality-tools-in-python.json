  "description": "This talk takes you on a whirlwind tour of data quality tools in Python.\nData quality has been a hot topic for a while, and there are several open\nsource Python-based packages out there that all cover different aspects of\nthe broad concept we call \"data quality\". But - which one is the right tool\nfor my use case? What do these tools do (or not do), and how do I know which\none to pick?\n\nWe'll first dive into a classification of the different types of data\nquality tools in the space, before looking at some hands-on examples of some\nof the most prominent packages. We'll be making brief stops at tools like\npydqc, datagristle, bulwark, dvc, dedupe, and Great Expectations, and see\nhands-on demos of each tool. The audience will walk away with a better\nunderstanding of \"what's out there\" and a little boost to get started using\ntheir tool of choice!",
