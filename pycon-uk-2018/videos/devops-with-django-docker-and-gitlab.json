  "description": "GitLab doesn't host your git repos, it also allows for continuous\nintegration and deployment. This means that after pushing to the Git\nrepo, your code is tested them deployed automatically.\n\nUsing this with Docker allows for fast Python deployments to production.\n\nIn this talk I will be showing you how to setup a basic CI/CD with\nGitLab. We will be making a basic Django project as an example.\n",
