  "description": "PythonCAD is a CAD package written, surprisingly enough, in Python using\nthe PyQt interface. The PythonCAD project aims to produce a scriptable,\nopen- source, easy to use CAD package for Linux (Cross Platforms).\n\nI start developing PythonCAD in my spare time and now python is the\nprogramming language that I mostly use. I think that will be very\ninteresting to tell my story and how I learn python pyqt ,sqlite, sympy\u2026\nand how python and pycon and OpenERP change my job.\n\nThe goal will be to tell at the new python programmer how easy to use is\npython even for complex problem. I can explain why I chose pyqt .. what\nkind of trouble I have found and how I solve it. Starting from python\ngoing to pyqt and at the end how to deploy a python application with\npyInstaller \u2026\n\nI also explain my actual project OpenPLM an OpenERP module to manage PLM\ndata into OpenERP\n\nsee you soon Matteo\n",
