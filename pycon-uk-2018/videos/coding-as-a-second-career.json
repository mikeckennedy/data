  "description": "How I found a second chance at a tech startup 20 years after opting for economics over computer science.\n\nThis session will tell the all too uncommon story of how I joined a tech\nstart-up and learned to code as a plucky 40-year old.\n\nHaving opted out of studying computer science at university because I\ndidn't fit in with the geeky, tech-loving boys in my classes, I joined\nthe Python community 20 years later than most and taught myself through\ntrial, error and a lot of Stack Overflow searches.\n\nI'll explain why people still do a double-take when they hear I'm a tech\nstart-up COO, why a career doesn\u2019t have to be a straight line, and why\nan analytical mindset, not an engineering background, is key for\nlearning to program.\n\nI'll reflect on what could have persuaded a young me to give computer\nscience a go, explain why kids having smartphones and RaspberryPis to\nplay with at home hasn't solved this problem, and challenge attendees to\ncommit to mentoring someone in their life who has never coded before.",
