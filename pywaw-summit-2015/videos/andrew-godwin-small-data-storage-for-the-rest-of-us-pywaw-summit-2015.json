  "description": "Talk: Small Data: Storage for the rest of us\n\nEverybody's always talking about Big Data, and aspiring to be the company that can expend whole datacentres just to handle their latest feature, but that has a massive engineering and ops cost - and as a small-to-medium company, that's probably not what you need.Learn about data storage patterns that are designed for the rest of us - how you can design data storage not just for scalability but also for rapid development, continuous deployment, and lower hardware requirements. Plus, a look at how to approach some more extreme storage challenges.\n\nSpeaker: Andrew Godwin. Andrew is a Django core developer and backend engineer, specialising in system architecture and data storage. He currently works on Eventbrite's Architecture team, helping to scale Eventbrite to handle an ever-growing number of events and users. In his spare time, he also enjoys archery, flying light aircraft, mountains, and cheese.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/andrewgodwin/small-data-storage-for-the-rest-of-us\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
