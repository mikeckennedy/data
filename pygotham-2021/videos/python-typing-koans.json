  "description": "Gradual typing was introduced in Python 3.5 standard library. Since then a\nlot of standard library changes, new PEPs, third-party libraries added\nsupport to type-hints. The flask 2.0 supports type-hints, SQLAlchemy,\nDjango(through the third-party stubs ) and a lot more of the libraries\nsupport gradual typing.\n\nThe resources to learn gradual typing are minimal and available in form of\ntalks. I have built a self-exploratory way to learn Python typing using the\nTDD/koans concept, [Python Typing\nKoans](https://github.com/kracekumar/python-typing-koans).\n\nThe materials has koans for learn typing the pure python code, Django code,\nDjango Rest Framework.\n\n[Here is a small demo video](https://asciinema.org/a/419119)\n\nIn this 10 minutes talk, I'll show how to use the tool to learn gradual\ntyping with hand-picked examples from a wide range of topics by\nadding/modifying the existing Python code and type-annotation.\n\nNote: Gradual typing, type-hints, optional static typing all refers to the\nsame concept.\n\nLinks:\n\n- Repo: [https://github.com/kracekumar/python-typing-koans](https://github.com/kracekumar/python-typing-koans)\n- Demo Video: [https://asciinema.org/a/419119](https://asciinema.org/a/419119)",
