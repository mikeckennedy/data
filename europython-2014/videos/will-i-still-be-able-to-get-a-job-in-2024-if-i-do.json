  "description": "TDD hasn't yet been embraced by everyone, but is it just a matter of\ntime? Ten years from now, will a non-TDD practicing developer experience\nthe horror of being labelled a technology adoption 'laggard', and be\nleft working exclusively on dreadfully boring legacy systems?\n\nIt could be a smart move to get down to your nearest Coding Dojo and\npractice TDD on some Code Katas. On the other hand, the thing with\ndisruptive technologies is that even they can become disrupted when\nsomething better comes along. What about Property-Based Testing?\nApproval Testing? Outside-In Development?\n\nIn this talk, I'd like to look at the chasm-crossing potential of TDD\nand some related technologies. My aim is that both you and I will still\nbe able to get a good job in 2024.\n",
