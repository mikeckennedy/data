  "description": "Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have shown how computers can\ncompete with humans in a variety of mundane tasks, but what happens when\ncreativity is required?\n\nThis talk introduces the concept of Natural Language Generation, the\ntask of automatically generating text, for examples articles on a\nparticular topic, poems that follow a particular style, or speech\ntranscripts that express some attitude. Specifically, we\u2019ll discuss the\ncase for Recurrent Neural Networks, a family of algorithms that can be\ntrained on sequential data, and how they improve on traditional language\nmodels.\n\nThe talk is for beginners, we\u2019ll focus more on the intuitions behind the\nalgorithms and their practical implications, and less on the\nmathematical details. Practical examples with Python will showcase\nKeras, a library to quickly prototype deep learning architectures.\n\nBrief outline:\n\n-  Introduction to Natural Language Generation\n-  Language Modelling\n-  Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short Term Memory for NLG\n-  RNN examples with Keras\n\nFeedback form: https://python.it/feedback-1574\n\nin \\_\\_on **Sunday 5 May** at 10:15 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
