  "description": "You just found that C library which solves that huge problem you have. It solves it completely, it's so fast, it's old, rock solid and well tested \u2013 and difficult to use, because it has that real-world, well aged C-API. Maybe even C++. So, you want to use it from Python, but there's no wrapper yet? Or worse, the existing wrapper is auto-generated and feels clumsy, slow and just as ugly to work with as C?\n\nGive Cython a try! It's the fastest way to make Python talk (to) native code, and a pleasure to work with as a general programming language.",
