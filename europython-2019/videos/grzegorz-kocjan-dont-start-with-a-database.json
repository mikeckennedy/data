  "description": "What you do when you start a new project? Usually, we begin with\ndatabase design, then we prepare a migration system, user registration,\nand all different stuff that distracts us from doing what is most\nimportant - business logic. With the clean architecture, we can learn\nhow to start a project in another way and this will be one of two main\ntopics of my talk. The second one will be about new features in Python.\nYou probably heard about typings, mypy, and dataclasses, but I will show\nyou how they can be used in real life project that can be developed over\nmany years in production lifecycle. There will be no \"hello world\" app,\nno copy & paste of documentation, only practical knowledge learned\nthrough many years of practice.",
