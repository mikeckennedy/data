  "description": "Businesses of all sizes can benefit from Python and its associated frameworks. The developer tools are extensive but the community of software engineers, programmers and analyst need a systematic approach that will guarantee a successful deployment on behalf of the business.\n\nBusiness Data Processing is a term that is not used regularly. It is relegated to the background while buzzwords like Apps, Full Stack Programming, Web Services and Cloud Computing dominate the landscape. Emphasis need to be placed back on Business Data Processing due to the ever changing needs of business and the flexibility afforded the technical community that utilize Python and its associated framework and tools to solve business problems.\n\nA worthy approach to business data processing using Python will be explored. Simplistic discussion on business values, requirements, agile development, user experience and support will be reviewed.",
