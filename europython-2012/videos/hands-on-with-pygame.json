  "description": "PyGame continues to be Python\u2019s most popular 2D game library, even\nthough there is growing competition from more modern OpenGL-based\nlibraries. It is still an excellent way to learn how our favorite games\nwork internally and to write similar games ourselves. During this\ntutorial I want to introduce the basics of using PyGame to create\ninteractive, animated graphical applications (such as games), and then\nhelp the participants make their own start at a simple adventure game,\nwhich they can later develop further into projects of their own. I want\nto concentrate on commonly used techniques and patterns in game\ndevelopment, which are useful no matter what library is used in the\nimplementation. In particular I will be discussing animations,\ntile-based maps, collision detection, event systems, internal\nrepresentation of game state and different approaches to code\norganisation and internal structure of games. I have previously created\na (much simpler) tutorial for creating a turn-based tile-based PyGame\ngame and a couple of games, such as Z-Day and Jelly . I will be using\nthe materials and experiences from those projects in the tutorial.\nPlease bring your laptop with Python 2.7 and PyGame installed.\n",
