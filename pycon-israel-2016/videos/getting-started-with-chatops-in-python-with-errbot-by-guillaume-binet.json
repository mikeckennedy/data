  "description": "ChatOps is about bringing your devops tools into your team chatroom. The recent rise of professional chatting services like Slack or Hipchat shows that people are embracing a new way of collaborating. Bringing your tools within those conversations tightens the feedback loop, improves information sharing and onboarding new people in your team. Some common operations implemented with chatops includes deployments, provisioning, monitoring, graphs, development tracking... Those are often implemented with the help of a chat bot like in this presentation Errbot. If your chatops system can be easily extended, for example here in Python, we will see that a team culture can crystallize around it with fun additions. This presentation's goal is to show you how easy it is to get started with chatops in Python, with some technical tips (installation, security, architecture...) but also some social tips to make your company understand better its potential for your team.\n\nSlides available here: http://il.pycon.org/2016/static/sessions/guillaume-binet.pdf",
