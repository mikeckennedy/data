  "description": "The DeepCare chatbot is capable of learning to answer customer questions. Using a hybrid approach of NLP and Deep Learning, it tries to combat logical fallacies that occur in pure deep learning bots, while still coming up with unique answers.\n\nIn particular, it uses a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) long-short-term-memory LSTM deep learning model to capture intricacies in questions. As organisations cannot afford a bot making logical mistakes, verification through NLP is used. This two-step model prevents the downside of \"no control\" on deep learning, as well as the too static nature of classical rule based NLP models, and thus enables potentially higher quality answers.\n\nA live demo will be available at http://deepcare.online on the day of the talk.",
