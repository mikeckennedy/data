In this talk I will review several tools\nwhich make this process easier for the user: simple APIs, galleries of\nexamples, umbrella functions for exploring algorithms, etc. Using such\ntools, some packages such as scikit-learn or scikit-image can be used to\nsolve efficiently data science questions, but also to improve one's\nculture and intuition in data science.\n",
