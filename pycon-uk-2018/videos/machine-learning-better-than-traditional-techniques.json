  "description": "Comparing Machine Learning and Traditional Time Series Techniques for Financial Series Prediction\n\nOver the past 5 years Machine Learning, Big Data and Data Science have\nbecome popular in finance, with jobs postings requiring these skills\nrising dramatically. However, the financial industry, like any other, is\nprone to fads. This year I have undertaken a research piece\ninvestigating whether Machine Learning models can outperform a model\nderived using 'traditional' time series prediction techniques (in this\ncase an ARIMA model) and whether Machine Learning can provide an analyst\nwith any additional insights into what could be driving trends observed\nin financial time series data. The latter suggesting that Machine\nLearning is another tool in the analyst's tool kit to be used alongside\ntraditional methods rather than a replacement.",
