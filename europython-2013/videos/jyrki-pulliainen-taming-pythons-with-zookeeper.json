  "description": "Concurrency is hard. Consistency in distributed systems is hard. And\nthen the whole thing should be highly-available and error resilient.\n\nFear not, there are good news: There exists an awesome tool called\nZooKeeper to help you with this. There even exists a plethora of Python\nlibraries for it, but how to know what to use and how?\n\nThis talk will walk you through ZooKeeper and how to use it with Python.\nWe\u2019ll be focusing on what I think is the most prominient ZooKeeper\nlibrary out there for Python: Kazoo.\n\nYou\u2019ll see how to do things in ZooKeeper and how to implement them using\nKazoo. We\u2019ll also peek in to the recipes Kazoo offers, and if we have\nenough time, touch a real life application we\u2019ve used Kazoo and\nZooKeeper to build at Spotify.\n",
