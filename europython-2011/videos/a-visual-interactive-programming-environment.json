  "description": "The Larch Environment is a visual interactive programming environment\nfor Jython/Python. Its purpose is to make programming more visual. To\nthis end, protocols for presenting objects visually have been devised. A\nprogramming environment, that builds on the idea of the standard visual\nconsole, allows a programmer to experiment with ideas, and develop\nprograms at the same time. Additionally, a way of embellishing source\ncode with visual content is presented.\n",
