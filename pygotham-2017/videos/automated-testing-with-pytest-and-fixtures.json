  "description": "Pytest is a free Python package that makes writing and running tests for your Python programs easier. Why use Pytest?\n\n- Automatic test discovery finds and executes tests based on the names of files and functions.\n- Multiple tests can run in parallel, saving time.\n- It's easy to group your tests and run just the relevant ones.\n- Testing that your code has raised and expected exception is easy.\n- Pytest \"fixtures\" are a powerful tool for:\n  - Setting up and tearing down objects or data required by your tests\n  - Parameterizing tests to run with different environments, inputs, etc.\n\nThis talk is ideal for a moderately technical audience. Basic knowledge of Python programming will be helpful, but is not required.",
