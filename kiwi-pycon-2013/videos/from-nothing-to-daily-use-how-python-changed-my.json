  "description": "@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Sunday, 08 Sep 2013 - Track 1\n\n**Audience level**\n\nNovice\n\n**Abstract**\n\nI will share my experiences of writing small python tools to help me to\nsolve the daily challenges of my job. I'm a very novice Python coder,\nand have only really been using\n\nThe range of tools I've used/built include:-\n\nfile format conversion, db building/analysing, XML wrangling, text data\nwrangling, object administration (inc. cleaning and audit), webscraping\nand basic workflow automation...\n\nI will share some (terribly coded) examples of how I solve analysis\nchallenges, share some limitations I have found being a solo novice\ncoder on the edge of a professional IT environment, and ask for your\nguidance in how to maintain the same rate of learning in the coding\nspace.\n\nTitle will change to be something more pithy.\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/jay-gattuso-from-nothing-to-daily-use-how-python-changed-my-work-life\n",
