  "description": "This is not a tutorial. It's an attempt to expose non data scientists experiencied pythonistas to the powerful pandas library. Most of python developers don't use pandas (either because they never heard of it, felt that it's a too steep learning curve or never thought that it will be useful for them). I intend to talk about python performance limitations and show how pandas can be used to overcome some of these limitations.\n\nSlides available here: http://il.pycon.org/2016/static/sessions/uzi-hs.pdf",
