  "description": "Peer learning, why it\u2019s effective in computer science education, and how to implement it in your own classroom\n\nUnlike few 16-year-olds out there, we have been in the unique position\nof experiencing computer science education both as students and as\neducators. Having both learned Python from other students, and taught it\nin a workshop to others, it is clear to us that one of the best ways to\nenhance a computer science education is through peer learning. Students\nusually have a knack for explaining things to their peers in a way that\nis approachable and understandable. (Although the presence of a teacher\nas a moderator is crucial in peer learning, it is often easier for\nstudents to relate to someone their own age.) Even if there\u2019s no direct\nexplaining involved, working together with another student can lead to\nenlightening discussions. We\u2019d like to share our experiences with peer\nlearning with other educators to encourage them to implement similar\npractices in their own classrooms, hopefully paving the way to an even\nmore effective computer science education.",
