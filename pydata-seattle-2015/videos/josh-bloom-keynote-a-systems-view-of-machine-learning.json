  "description": "Despite the growing abundance of powerful tools, building and deploying machine-learning frameworks into production continues to be major challenge, in both science and industry. I'll present some particular pain points and cautions for practitioners as well as recent work addressing some of the nagging issues. I advocate for a systems view, which, when expanded beyond the algorithms and codes to the organizational ecosystem, places some interesting constraints on the teams tasked with development and stewardship of ML products.\n\nSlides available here: http://www.slideshare.net/JoshuaBloom/a-systems-view-of-machine-learnipydata-2015",
