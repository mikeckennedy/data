  "summary": "Authors: Warner, Joshua, Mayo Clinic Department of Biomedical\nEngineering; Ottesen, Hal H., Adjunct Professor\n\nTrack: General\n\nScikit-fuzzy is a robust set of foundational tools for problems\ninvolving fuzzy logic and fuzzy systems. This area has been a challenge\nfor the scientific Python community, largely because the common first\nexposure to this topic is through the MATLAB\u00ae Fuzzy Logic Toolbox\u2122. This\ntalk officially introduces a general set of original fuzzy logic\nalgorithms to the scientific Python community which predate the\ncommercial toolbox, were released under the 3-clause BSD license, and\nwere translated to Python by an author who never used the MathWorks\u00c2\u00ae\nFuzzy Logic Toolbox\u2122.\n\nThe current capabilities of scikit-fuzzy include: fuzzy membership\nfunction generation; fuzzy set operations; lambda-cuts; fuzzy\nmathematics including Zadeh's extension principle, the vertex method,\nand the DSW method; fuzzy implication given an IF THEN system of fuzzy\nrules (via Mamdani [min] or Larsen [product] implication); various\ndefuzzification algorithms; fuzzy c-means clustering; and Fuzzy\nInference Ruled by Else-action (FIRE) denoising of 1d or 2d signals.\n\nThe goals of scikit-fuzzy are to provide the community with a robust\ntoolkit of independently developed and implemented fuzzy logic\nalgorithms, filling a void in the capabilities of scientific and\nnumerical Python, and to increase the attractiveness of scientific\nPython as a valid alternative to closed-source options. Scikit-fuzzy is\nstructured similarly to scikit-learn and scikit-image, current source\ncode is available on GitHub, and pull requests are welcome.\n",
