Today I would like to address a second level question. How to make the success scale? How to build a DS team in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts?\r\nIn this talk, I will share lessons learned during my 4 years as data science team & group leader on how to build a DS team that prospers while addressing the unique challenges of leading such a team.\r\nWe will discuss how to create the setting for a DS to grow and research while driving winning results for the organization. I will share our AI playbook that enables us to select the right projects to maximize our value and to collaborate with our partners most effectively to bring them to production. In addition we will discuss the importance of communication with upper management and how to do it right.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/LWUWAU\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
