  "description": "This talk introduces Computational Social Science as a new research\ndiscipline, gives a brief introduction to Natural Language Processing\nand explains how Word Vector Representations are computed and how to use\nthem in Python. Word Vector Representations like word2vec encode\nsemantic relationships like gender and \"is the capital city of\". This\nmakes it easy to find similar words and compare them visually. To\nillustrate this, I am using the gensim and scikit-learn Python libraries\nto compare my own Google searches from 2011 and 2014. I will also\nexplain how to use this to compare the topics in books and book\nsummaries.\n",

  "summary": "If you convert words into vectors, you can do interesting things with\nthem. You can compare the topics in a book, make better translations\nand tell if a sentence is positive or negative. Python libraries like\ngensim and spaCy make it easy to play with this for fun, profit or\nsocial science.",
