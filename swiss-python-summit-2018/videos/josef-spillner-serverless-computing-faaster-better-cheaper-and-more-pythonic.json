  "description": "Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is the consequent code-level implementation of the microservices concept in which each function or method is separately instantiated, measured, accounted and billed. As a programming and deployment model, it has become popular for discrete event processing. Several public commercial services offer FaaS hosting, but almost always in silos with arbitrary limits, incompatible tooling for each provider, and no convenient sharing of functions.\n\nSnake Functions (Snafu) contrasts these constraints. It is a novel free software tool to fetch, execute, test and host functions implemented in Python and (with slight performance overhead) in other languages, too.",
