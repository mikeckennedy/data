  "description": "In this video, I'm answering a few of the pandas questions I've received in the YouTube comments: Could you explain how to read the pandas documentation? What is the difference between ufo.isnull() and pd.isnull(ufo)? Why are DataFrame slices inclusive when using .loc, but exclusive when using .iloc? How do I randomly sample rows from a DataFrame?\n\nThis is video 23 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
