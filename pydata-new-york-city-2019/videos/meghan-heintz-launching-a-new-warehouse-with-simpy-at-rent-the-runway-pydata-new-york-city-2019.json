  "description": "Opening a warehouse is a long and challenging process, not to mention costly. So if you're going to go through all that work to open and operate a warehouse, you'll want to make sure you can run it as efficiently as possible. Enter SimPy (rhymes with 'Blimpie'). SimPy is a discrete event simulator software library that allows us to asynchronously schedule and process events.",
