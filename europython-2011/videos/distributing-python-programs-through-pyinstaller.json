  "description": "The talk will focus on how to distribute multi-platform proprietary\nPython applications, using `PyInstaller <http://www.pyinstaller.org>`__.\n\nPyInstaller takes a program written in Python and turns it into a static\nexecutable (binary) that does not depend upon an existing Python\ninstallation, nor third party library. The executable can then be packed\nand shipped in many different ways (through installer wizards, deb/rpm\npackages, etc.).\n\nPyInstaller is a good multi-platform alternative to tools like py2exe\nand py2app, but it found troubles to gain acceptance in a market that\nseems strongly tied to older tools. Instead, PyInstaller puts forward\nimportant new features: for instance, it works on the most important\ndesktop platforms (Windows, Linux/UNIX, Mac), and it has got an\nautomatic and fully transparent support for all the workarounds needed\nto make applications using complex libraries like Matplotlib or PyQt\nwork within a static executable.\n\nIn detail, the following points will be discussed:\n\n-  Distribution of a priopriertary software: initial requests\n-  PyInstaller: how it works (basic tutorial)\n-  The secrets of PyInstaller: technical details\n-  Import hooks: effectively handling third party extensions\n-  Flexibility with PyInstaller: what goes in and what stays out\n-  Linux: static binaries for a single distribution or\n   cross-distributions\n-  Mac: creation of bundles for graphic applications\n\n",
