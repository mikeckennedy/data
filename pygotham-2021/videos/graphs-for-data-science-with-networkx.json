  "description": "Graphs are simple concepts: a set of individual Nodes (components) connected\nby Edges (relationships). In this very simplicity lies their power. They can\ndescribe the structure of our friendships, connections between airports, the\nspread of diseases from person to person, the relation of one concept to\nanother, how species interact in an ecosystem or how computers communicate\nto form the World Wide Web.\n\nNetworks are the fundamental language of our increasingly complex world and\nthe key to successfully understand it. By exploring in detail the way graphs\ncan be used to explore, describe, analyze and understand empirical datasets\nwe will put you at the forefront of this growing field.\n\nIn this lecture we will use Python's NetworkX to build our understanding of\nnetwork representations and algorithms by exploring real world network\ndatasets such as the airline transportation network, the bitcoin transaction\nnetwork, the road network of open street map, etc. Through this practical\napproach attendees will better understand the fundamental ideas and concepts\nthat lie at the base of  our increasingly complex world and take the first\nsteps towards being at the forefront of this growing field.",
