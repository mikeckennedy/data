  "description": "Jupyter Notebooks and interactive programming have become one of the most popular tools for developing Python due to its flexibility and ease of use. Visual Studio Code now offers a first class Notebooks experience along with many great features for Data Scientists and Python developers alike. Come see how you can explore, experiment and productionize machine learning models using the flexibility of Notebooks combined with the power and productivity of VS Code. Along the way we\u2019ll also be connecting to several Azure services from within VS Code, including Azure Virtual Machines for running the training job, Azure Storage for storing the dataset and model, Azure Functions for deploying our model and endpoint, and Azure Web Service for running a web application for making predictions.",
