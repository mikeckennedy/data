  "description": "The NCSU Libraries are supporting the next generation of researchers\nthrough basic training in core elements of the modern research skill\nset like Python and scientific computing. We\u2019ll show how we are\nsimplifying the learning experience for novice data scientists using\nVagrant and Ansible to provision reproducible computing environments\nfor use in our Summer of Open Science workshop series.\n\nModern research practice asks researchers to engage with information\nin new ways through the use of digital technologies. The landscape of\nthis skillset is rapidly changing and difficult to pinpoint at an\ninterdisciplinary level. The modern researcher is expected to navigate\ndigital tools that are not unique to the work that they do on a daily\nbasis within their discipline and to be able to share that work in\nmeaningful ways with collaborators.\n\nOpen science has become increasingly relevant to modern scientific\npractice and reflects the development of the modern research skill\nset. There is a rising tide of policy that requires researchers to\nnavigate open methodology in order to gain access to grant funding.\nDespite a shift towards support of open science in major policy making\nbodies, such as the OECD, the training that early career researchers\nreceive has not caught up with this fast changing policy landscape.",
