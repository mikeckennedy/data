  "description": "Blockly is a front-end GUI developed by Google that allows developers to create a drag-and-drop language for their product. However Blockly only generates a string and does not run code directly. I will take a look at the various potential approaches to execute code that is in a string: exec - quick for short commands subprocess - can be interrupted * multiprocessing - can pass data back and forth by using queues The talk is mainly about launching processes, dealing with zombies, interrupting processes based on user input and passing data back and forth between processes. Brief mentions of Flask are to be expected. Examples will be based on my experience in developing Bloxter a graphical drag-and-drop language for the GoPiGo3 to be used at home or in classrooms.\n\nMontr\u00e9al-Python 67: Ultramodern Vintage - PyCon Canada Special\nhttps://montrealpython.org/2017/10/mp67/",
