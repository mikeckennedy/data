  "description": "mrjob: Distributed Computing for Everyone\n\nPresented by Jimmy Retzlaff\n\nHave tons of data that needs analysis? Now it's as easy as 1-2-3! 1)\nSign up for an Amazon Web Services account. 2) Install Yelp's mrjob. 3)\nWrite as few as a dozen lines of Python code. This talk will show you\nhow to use mrjob and Amazon's Elastic MapReduce to easily process lots\nof data in parallel on a potentially large cluster of computers that you\ncan rent for a dime per computer per hour.\n\nAbstract\n\nIn their 2004 paper, Google outlined MapReduce - one of the programming\nmodels they use to process large data sets. MapReduce is a relatively\nsimple model to develop for that allows the underlying framework to\nautomatically parallelize the job, add fault tolerance, and scale the\njob to many commodity computers.\n\nIn 2009, Amazon Web Services introduced their Elastic MapReduce (EMR)\nproduct. It layers the Hadoop open source package on top of their\nElastic Compute Cloud (EC2) to allow anyone to rent a cluster of\ncomputers by the hour, starting at about a dime per computer per hour,\nin order to run MapReduce jobs.\n\nSome of the significant issues with Amazon's solution involve starting\nup machine instances, replicating your code and its dependancies to EMR,\nrunning and monitoring the job, and gathering the results.\n\nSo Yelp developed mrjob, which takes care of these details and lets the\ndeveloper focus on working with their data. Yelp uses mrjob to power\nmany internal jobs that work with its very large log files, for example:\n\n-  People Who Viewed This Also Viewed...\n-  A user clicked an ad over and over, but we only want to charge the\n   advertiser once\n-  We're thinking of a change, but want to simulate how that will affect\n   ad revenue\n\nNow you can use that same power with just a few lines of Python.\n\nUseful links:\n\n-  Install mrjob: sudo easy\\_install mrjob\n-  Documentation: http://packages.python.org/mrjob/\n-  PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mrjob\n-  Development is hosted at github: http://github.com/Yelp/mrjob\n\n",
