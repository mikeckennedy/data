  "abstract": "Survival Analysis aims to predict the time until a particular event\nhappens. In medical research, this could be the time until a person dies\nafter a certain illness, but in the world of subscription businesses,\nthis is the time until a customer stops wanting your product. In this\ntalk, I'll show how we use techniques in Survival Analysis and Machine\nLearning to predict the time a customer (and their dog) will keep\nordering our products. I'll also show how this is an important part of\nunderstanding the Lifetime Value of a customer, which is arguably the\nmost important metric in any subscription business.\n",
