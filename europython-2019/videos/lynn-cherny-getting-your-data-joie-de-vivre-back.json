  "description": "Most of us work too much and play too little. When was the last time you\nsmiled at something you made? Playing with fun datasets, especially big\ndata sets, opens up weird new forms of technical recreation. Why not\ntrain an amusing model in a browser tab while you're waiting for that\nday-job Spark query to finish? I'll show you some data toys I've built\nusing AI and interesting data sets: Most of them involve both backend\ndata science and front-end visualization tricks. They range from\npoetry-composition helpers to game log analysis to image deconstruction\nand reconstruction. All of them taught me something, often about myself\nand what I like artistically, and sometimes about what \"big data\"\nactually means.",
