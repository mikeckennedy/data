  "description": "@MagicRealismBot is a Twitter bot that randomly generates succinct story synopses that it can tweet. In this talk we will show how we can use TextBlob (and NLTK) to analyse the stories generated by @MagicRealismBot and extract the underlying patterns used to generate the tweets. We will show how TextBlob can be used to analyses the tweets (for example, by sentence extraction and part-of-speech tagging) allowing us to 'reverse engineer' the underlying patterns of the Twitter bot. We will also highlight the variety of other analyses that TextBlob can perform and touch on the state of natural language processing in Python, and elsewhere.",
