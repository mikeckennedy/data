  "description": "The (lack of) design patterns in Python\n\nPresented at PyCon 2009 by Joe Gregorio\n\nThere is a distinct lack of Design Patterns discussed in relation to\nPython. Are the communities ignorant of Design Patterns or is there\nsomething else going on here? This talk is based on my well-trafficked\narticle \"Python isn't just Java without the compile\" and expands on that\narticle by using Design Patterns as a crude metric of gaps in a\nprogramming language.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: ]\n",
