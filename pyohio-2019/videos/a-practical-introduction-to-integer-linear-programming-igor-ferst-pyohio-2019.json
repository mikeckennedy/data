  "description": "Integer linear programming (ILP) is a powerful framework for solving\noptimization problems related to scheduling, resource allocation,\nvehicle routing, and many other areas. This talk will give a brief\nintroduction to ILP and show how to solve a real-world vehicle routing\nproblem using Google's open-source python library for ILP.\n\nHow do airlines choose which planes service which routes? How does a\nhospital optimize the shift schedule for hundreds of doctors and nurses?\nHow do you choose the optimal location for a group of fulfillment\ncenters, or oil derricks, or cell towers? These kinds of problems (and\nmany others!) can be solved with integer linear programming (ILP), a\npowerful and decades-old framework for solving optimization problems. In\nthis talk we will give a brief introduction to ILP and describe it's\nuses, strengths, and weaknesses. We will also show how to solve a\nreal-world vehicle routing problem using Google's open-source python\nlibrary for ILP. Trigger warning: this talk will contain high-school\nlevel math.\n",
