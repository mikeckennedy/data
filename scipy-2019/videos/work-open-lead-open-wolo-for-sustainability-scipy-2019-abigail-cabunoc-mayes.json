  "description": "Unique principles of working open provide the best platform to sustainably solve the problems we face today. Open leaders design and build projects that empower others to collaborate in inclusive communities. By designing for open, projects lower barriers to participation and encourage sustainable use and contribution. In this talk, we'll take experiences mentoring over 500 open projects to discuss how and why working open leads to sustainable software.",
