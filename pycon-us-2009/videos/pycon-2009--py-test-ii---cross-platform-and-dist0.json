Use a\ntool that allows you to ad-hoc distribute tests to multiple CPUs for\nspeed and to multiple platforms for compatibility checks? With tons of\ndebugging help in failure situations? This tutorial provides in-depth\ninformation on advanced usages of the popular py.test tool. We highlight\nits current feature set including using and writing extensions for\ngenerating HTML pages, testing Javascript or ReST documents.
