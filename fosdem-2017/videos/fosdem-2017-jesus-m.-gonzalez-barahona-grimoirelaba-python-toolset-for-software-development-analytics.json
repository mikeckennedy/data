  "description": "The talk will explain how to analyze software development repositories of common use in the free software community with [GrimoireLab tools][http://grimoirelab.github.io], a toolset for software development analytics writting in Python. It will start by explaining how to retrieve data from git, Bugzilla, GitHub, mailing lists, StackOverflow, Gerrit, and many other repositories by, and organizing it in a database. The talk will later explain how this database can be exploited with several components of the toolset, for different purposes. In this context, special attention will be given to how to extract useful information from it using Python/Pandas and iPython/Jupyter Notebooks; and how to use ElasticSearch/Kibana to deploy actionable dashboards that show data in all its glory.",
