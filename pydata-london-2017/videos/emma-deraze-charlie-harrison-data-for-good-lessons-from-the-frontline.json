  "description": "Filmed at PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nDataKind UK share their experiences and critical success factors from 3 years of learning-by-doing in using data in the service of humanity.\n\nAbstract\nMost of us will know data for business as the art and science of using proprietary data to solve high value commercial problems. But how can those same techniques be used to solve societal problems as well? From tackling money laundering through network statistics to establishing the true scale of youth homelessness through Bayesian inference, DataKind UK will share examples of how they\u2019ve partnered with charities to use data for good. Reflecting on what has and hasn\u2019t worked in three years, they will share the critical success factors they\u2019ve identified along the way.",
