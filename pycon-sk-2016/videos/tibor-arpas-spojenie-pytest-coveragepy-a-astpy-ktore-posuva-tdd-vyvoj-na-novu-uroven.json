  "description": "Users and especially developers hate waiting. Computing has adapted and\nwe almost never wait for the computer for more than 10 seconds. One big\nexception is running a test suite, which takes MINUTES on many projects.\nThat is incredibly distracting, frustrating and dragging the whole\nconcept of automated tests down.\n\nI will present a technique and a tool (py.test plugin called \u201ctestmon\"),\nwhich automatically selects only tests affected by recent changes. Does\nit sound too good to be true? Python developers rightfully have a\nsuspecting attitude towards any tool, which tries to be too clever about\ntheir source code. Code completion and symbol searching doesn\u2019t need to\nbe 100% reliable but messing with the test suite execution? I will show\nthat we can significantly reduce the test suite execution time without\nlosing its reliability.\n",
