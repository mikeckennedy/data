  "description": "Two people died because of a Unicode support error. Another died\nbecause of a camera\u2019s inability to distinguish colours from one\nanother, and yet another died because of bad GPS data. Many thousands\nmore deaths could have been prevented by a single variable, if the\ndevelopers had thought to include it.\n\nAs software developers, our skills and ideas are increasingly crucial\nfor keeping the world running. We don\u2019t have time to test for, find,\nand fix all of the bugs. Most bugs are annoying, some bugs allow for\nsneaky behaviour, but the most innocuous of edge cases can sometimes\nlead to an actual loss of life.\n\nNo software ever holds up to contact with reality, but in this talk,\nLilly Ryan shows you some of the more extreme consequences of tech\ndebt, and offers guidelines on how your team can more easily identify\nassumptions and eliminate edge case behaviour when developing\nsoftware. That boring task hiding in your backlog might just save a\nlife.",
