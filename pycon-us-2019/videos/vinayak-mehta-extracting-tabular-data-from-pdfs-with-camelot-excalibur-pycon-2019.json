  "description": "Extracting tables from PDFs is hard. The Portable Document Format was\nnot designed for tabular data. Sadly, a lot of open data is shared as\nPDFs and getting tables out for analysis is a pain. A simple\ncopy-and-paste from a PDF into a text file or spreadsheet program\ndoesn't work.\n\nThis talk will briefly touch upon the history of the Portable Document\nFormat, discuss some problems that arise when extracting tabular data\nfrom PDFs using the current ecosystem of libraries and tools and\ndemonstrate how Camelot and Excalibur solve this problem better and in a\nscalable manner. These easy-to-use packages automatically detect and\nextract tables from PDFs and give you access to the extracted tables in\npandas DataFrames. You can also download them as CSVs or Excel files.\n",
