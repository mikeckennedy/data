  "abstract": "This talk is an overview aimed at Python users who are interested in\nmachine learning, wildlife, and/or sound processing. It covers topics\nfrom the academic research project I lead, all implemented in Python,\nwith tips throughout about libraries we use, handy bits of open code\n(including the winning entry from a machine learning data challenge I\nled last year), as well as sources of open data for audio experiments.\n\nTopics include classifying sounds, detecting sounds, how we deployed our\nPython research code directly as a commercial app, and a flavour of the\nmore cutting-edge research topics we're focussing on now. This will not\nbe a tutorial on deep learning - instead it will show examples of how we\nuse these methods for audio analysis.\n",

  "description": "Bird sounds are complex and fascinating. Can we automatically\n\"understand\" them using machine learning? I will describe my academic\nresearch into \"machine listening\" for bird sounds. I'll tell you why\nit's important, methods we use, Python libraries, open code and open\ndata that you can use. Examples of the latest research, and a successful\ncommercial recognition app (Warblr).\n",
