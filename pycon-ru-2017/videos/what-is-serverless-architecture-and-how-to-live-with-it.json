  "description": "Why use dedicated servers if you don't need them? In modern times, we are already able to just build the whole complex pipelines and deploy applications directly on the cloud, without \"cutting\" it to separate instances. And you may don't even care how and where things are going to be executed. It's just several lines of code and no more non-trivial maintenance and deployment, just pure business logic. Magic? No, it's serverless.\n",
