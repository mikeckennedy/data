  "description": "Viri is a system for automatic distribution and execution of Python code\non remote machines. This is especially useful when dealing with a large\ngroup of hosts.\n\nWith Viri, Sysadmins can write their own scripts, and easily distribute\nand execute them on any number of remote machines. Depending on the\nnumber of computers to administrate, Viri can save thousands of hours,\nthat Sysadmins would spend transferring files, logging into remote\nhosts, and waiting for the scripts to finish. Viri automates the whole\nprocess.\n\nViri can also be useful for remotely managing host settings. It should\nwork together with an application where the information about hosts\nwould be maintained. This information can include cron tasks, firewall\nrules, backup settings,etc. After a simple Integration of this\napplication with your Viri infrastructure, you can change any settings\nin the application, and see how it gets applied on the target host\nautomatically.\n\nThe talk will cover next topics:\n\n-  Introduction to Viri\n-  Live demo on how to install Viri, write a Viri task, and execute it\n   in a remote host\n-  Security concerns using Viri\n\nCheck `Viri project page <http://www.viriproject.com>`__\n",
