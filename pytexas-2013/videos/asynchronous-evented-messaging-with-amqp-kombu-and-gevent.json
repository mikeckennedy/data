  "description": "Modern enterprise applications, particularly those utilizing cloud services, need to be reliable, scalable, flexible, and performant. We explore how to use AMQP to build applications with all four of those attributes, how to use Kombu to integrate AMQP with Python, and introduce gevent to build additional flexibility and performance into Python applications. We'll give a brief overview of each of the components, provide some code samples for interesting use cases, then discuss possible applications of the powers of all three combined.",
