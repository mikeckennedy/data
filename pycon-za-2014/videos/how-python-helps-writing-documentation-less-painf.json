  "summary": "We all know writing documentation is an arduous exercise. We all know\nhow useless and frustrating out-of-date or just plain incorrect\ndocumentation is. In this talk I'd like to demonstrate how Python can\nhelp make writing documentation, keeping it up-to-date and verifying its\nvalidity. It can be surprising what happens when other people discover\nyour little-but-well-documented API. Python has several built-in\nconcepts and standard tools to help making this easier, such as\ndocstrings, help(), Sphinx, Sphinx plugins, Doctests and generating\ndocumentation off tests themselves. I'll focus on not only using Sphinx\nas a tool, but also on how to structure your application/library/tool so\nas to make writing accurate documentation as simple as possible.\n",
