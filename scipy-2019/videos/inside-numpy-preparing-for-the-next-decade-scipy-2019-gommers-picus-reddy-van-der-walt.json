  "description": "Over the past year, and for the first time since its creation, NumPy has been operating with dedicated funding. NumPy developers think it has invigorated the project and its community. But is that true, and how can we know? We will give an overview of the actions we've taken to improve the sustainability of the NumPy project and its community. We will draw some lessons from a first year of grant-funded activity, discuss key obstacles faced, attempt to quantify what we need to operate sustainably, and present a vision for the project and how we plan to realize it.",
