    "description": "Speaker:: Marysia Winkels James Hayward\n\nTrack: PyData: PyData & Scientific Libraries Stack\nFrom inventory to website visitors, resource planning to financial data, time-series data is all around us. Knowing what comes next is key to success in this dynamically changing world. And for that we need reliable forecasting models. While complex & deep models may be good at forecasting, they typically give us little insight about the underlying patterns in our data. Such insights however may be a key to not only forecasting the future but shaping it.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we'll cover relatively simple approaches for time series analysis and seasonality modelling with Pandas.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/DTTQ9D\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
