  "description": "Python may be one of the simplest and most flexible programming languages out there, but it is still a programming language. It still has syntax, datatypes, and some occasional dark corners. Python \"warts\" are things for which people have criticized Python, typically aspects of the language or mechanisms of its implementation, because such aspects either expose certain surprising inconsistencies, are regarded as omissions, or cause irritation for parts of the community in some sense.\nThis talk will be about common pitfalls (termed warts/landmines) that people face using Python programming language.\nPrerequisites: The only prerequisite is that you must have some basic familiarity with Python programming language. Although it'll be good that you have laptops with Python already setup, it's not required as such!\nIf you are really curious how this talk will go, you can watch a similar talk for Ruby and Javascript at the https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat site.\n\n\n\n--------\n\nFounder and Organizer for PyData Delhi. Keynote and international speaker at many Python conferences around the world. To-be Software Engineer at Yelp!",
