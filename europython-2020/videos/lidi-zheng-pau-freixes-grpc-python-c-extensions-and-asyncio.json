  "description": "How to make AsyncIO work with the gRPC Core\n\nGoal - Encourage Python developers to understand C extensions by sharing gRPC Python\u2019s practice, and advocate the adoption of AsyncIO.\r\n\r\nPrerequisite\r\n- Understand thread vs. process;\r\n- Interested in asynchronous programming.\r\n\r\ngRPC Brief\r\n- What\u2019s gRPC Core? And what is gRPC Python?\r\n\r\nCython To The Rescue\r\n- Why we picked Cython among all other available tools (e.g., pybind11, ctypes)\r\n- Debuggability: pdb & gdb\r\n\r\nThe GIL Friction\r\n- How to delegate work to C extension\r\n- How to make multithreading work\r\n\r\nAsyncIO Topic\r\n- Not blocking the loop, the main headache.\r\n- Non-blocking I/O solution 1: replacing C libraries\u2019 I/O operations\r\n- Non-blocking I/O solution 2: dedicated background poller thread\r\n- Performance improvement (10k -> 20k for client, 4k -> 16k for server)\r\n\r\n\r\nMigration to AsyncIO\r\n- Tolerate multithreading and AsyncIO in the same application\r\n- Make both API co-existable in the same application",
