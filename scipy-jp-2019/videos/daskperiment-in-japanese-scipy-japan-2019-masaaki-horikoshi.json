  "description": "Data analysis, including machine learning, requires a lot of trial and error. The results are dependent on hyperparameters, codes, packages, etc., so you may not be able to reproduce past results. This talk will show you what you need to do to make your machine learning experiment reproducible and the tools for that. The core tool, ' daskperiment ', is intuitive, regardless of machine learning algorithms or packages, and tracks the information you need. Internally, the Dask mechanism is used to efficiently perform the steps in the experiment. Users can have this package and make their own experiments reproducible.\n\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
