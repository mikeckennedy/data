  "description": "Fast Engineering Computation in with Boost::Python and Numarray\n\nPresented by Filip Zalio (NEC Australia)\n\nIn the 3G Mobile Research and Development Division in NEC Australia\n(www.nec.com.au) we have been using Python based environment since 2005.\nWe run digital signal processing simulations of 3G and 4G mobile phone\nradio links. Our simulations are CPU-bound, where efficient and fast\ninterfacing between C++ and Python is one of the keys to the growing\nsuccess of Python within NEC. In this short presentation, we describe\nour current framework which achieves the fast processing.\n",
