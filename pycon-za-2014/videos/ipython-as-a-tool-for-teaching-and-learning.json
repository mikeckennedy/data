  "summary": "The ipython environment lends itself to teaching and learning: immediate\nfeedback, flexible visualisation, easy access to docstrings and ability\nto explore modules. With development of the ipython notebook, this is\ntaken a step further, by providing browser-based access to an ipython\nenvironment with the ability to share notebooks with others, embed\noutput products and annotate code. I will present some experience of\nusing ipython as a teaching tool in a tertiary teaching environment in\nRadio Astronomy courses in Windhoek, Nairobi and Cape Town.\n",
