  "description": "(Renee Noble) I\u2019ve been a big fan of the BBC micro:bit for years now, but then I heard there was a *new Aussie kid* on the *embedded systems block*, the \u201cKookaberry\u201d. I was interested to hear more but skeptical that it could lure me away from the micro:bit lifestyle where I\u2019d invested my time learning and developing content. But here I am, 6 months into my Kookaberry journey, and I\u2019m a total convert. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll take you through my journey of discovery and show you how Kookaberry gives you an easier entry point to MicroPython and embedded systems for beginners, more extendable, realistic, and relatable project experiences for your existing programmers (without having to get the breadboards out!), and how you can utilise Kookaberry in a huge range of cross-curricular applications.\n\nhttps://2021.pycon.org.au/program/NXYTWM/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country\u2019s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 09:30:00 2021 at Education",
