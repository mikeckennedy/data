  "description": "Launch Jupyter to the Cloud: an example of using Docker and Terraform\n\nIn this talk, we will use a task: hiring a GPU on Google Cloud Platform to train neural network, as an example to show how an application can be deployed on a cloud platform with Docker and Terraform. The goal is to have Jupyter Notebook running in an environment with Tensorflow (GPU version) and other libraries installed on a Google Compute Engine.\n\nThis talk is for people with no experience in application deployment on cloud service but would benefit form computational reproducibility and cloud service, potentially data scientists/ analysts or tech practitioners who didn't have a software developing background. We will use an example that is simple but useful in data science to demonstrate basic usage of Docker and Terraform which would be beneficial to beginners who would like to simplify their work flow with those tools.",
