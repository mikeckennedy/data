    "description": "DjangoCon Europe 2020 (Virtual)\nSeptember 19, 2020 - 09h15 (GMT+1)\n\n\"Ceci n'est pas un job\" by Leila Verhaegen\n\nMore than once I have had the pleasure of being informed that my job (which by the way, is also the job of quite a few members of the DjangoCon audience) is not a \u201creal\u201d job. In this talk I will try to discover what a \u201creal job\u201d is. I will also find out more about what is \u201creal\u201d, and what is a \u201cjob\u201d. As a person who allegedly does not have a real job, and who comes from a country (Belgium) whose reality some people also doubt, I am ideally placed to make these discoveries. I will enlist the assistance of some famous Belgians, including the famous philosopher-actor Jean-Claude Van Damme (not a real actor, according to some; not a real philosopher, according to others) and the artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte. I plan to show that being a web developer is not really a job - it\u2019s much more important than that.",
