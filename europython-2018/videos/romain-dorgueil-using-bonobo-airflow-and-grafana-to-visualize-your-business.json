  "description": "Zero-to-one hands-on introduction to building a business dashboard using\nBonobo ETL, Airflow, and a bit of Grafana (because graphs are cool).\n\nThere is no need of prior knowledge about any of those tools.\n\nAfter a short introduction about the tools, we\u2019ll go through the\nfollowing topics, using the real data of a small SaaS software:\n\n-  Plan (What data do we need to see?)\n-  Implement (How do we quickly get those graphs up?)\n-  Monitor (Are you sure your data\u2019s still there?)\n-  Iterate (How do we move on from there?)\n\nOne can expect to be able to build a similar system at the end of the\ntalk in a few days (of course, the implementation is only a small part\nof this process, data is what really matters).\n\n\u00abMetrics you watch tend to improve over time\u00bb\n",
