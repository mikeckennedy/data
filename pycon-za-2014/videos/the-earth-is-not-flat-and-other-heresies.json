  "summary": "Any decent textbook on astrophysics starts with a historical prologue\nrunning something like this: \"Once upon a time, we believed the earth\nwas flat. We were wrong. Once upon a time, we believed the sun rotated\naround the earth. We were wrong.\" It's a shame that computer science\ntextbooks don't start the same way: \"Once upon a time, we believed that\nall computer languages would be statically compiled. We were wrong. Once\nupon a time, we believed that execution would always be single-threaded,\non a single processor, on a single machine. We were wrong.\" The world of\ntechnology is marching on toward ever more concurrent architectures,\nalso called \"Cloud\", and various other buzzwords. The transition is at\nonce so mundane as to go unnoticed, and so fundamental as to shake the\nvery foundations of computer science. This talk explores the past,\npresent, and future of the \"Cloud\", and the implications for Python and\nother open source projects.\n",
