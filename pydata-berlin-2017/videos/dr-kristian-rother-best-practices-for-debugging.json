  "description": "This tutorial introduces concepts and techniques for systematic debugging. Participants will debug example programs with different kinds of bugs and with increasing difficulty.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nDebugging is a daily activity of any programmer. Frequently, it is assumed that programmers can debug. However, programmers often have to deal with existing code that simply does not work. This tutorial attempts to change that by introducing concepts for debugging and corresponding programming techniques.\n\nIn this tutorial, participants will learn strategies for systematically debugging Python programs. We will work through a series of examples, each with a different kind of bug and with increasing difficulty. The training will be interactive, combining one-person and group activities, to improve your debugging skills in an entertaining way.\n\nContents:\nSyntax Error against Runtime exceptions\nDebugging with the scientific method\nInspection of variables with print and introspection functions\nUsing an interactive debugger\nLogging\nCode Review\n\n",
