  "description": "Emu86 is a browser-based interpreter for x86 assembly language written in Python, using the Django framework. It allows code-stepping, displays registers, flags, memory, and the stack, and provides online help for all instructions. It is a great learning tool for introducing students to assembler, and it illustrates the potential of \"courseware as code\" for education.",
