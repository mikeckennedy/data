  "summary": "I released the first version of PyEphem in 1998. Built with SWIG, it\nmade astronomical calculations in Python only slightly more convenient\nthan writing C code to make raw calls to the libastro library. A massive\nrewrite five years later improved the interface, but a decade of\nfielding questions from users has convinced me to re-think how an API\ncan better help programmers cope with an unfamiliar and complex domain\nlike astronomy. This talk will explore how API design, NumPy\nintegration, and modern high-performance Python computation combine in\nSkyfield, the new pure-Python astronomy library that I will release\nduring the PyCon Canada sprints!\n",
