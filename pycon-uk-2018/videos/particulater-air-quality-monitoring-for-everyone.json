  "description": "A citizen data science project for monitoring an individuals exposure to pollutants\n\nAir pollution is getting worse across the world, but how does an\nindividual know how to reduce their exposure?\n\nI will be presenting my project that is focused on personalised air\nquality monitoring. The battery-powered device measures air pollution,\nas well as a series of other environmental variables. The data is then\ntransmitted wirelessly to my Home Assistant instance. This allows a user\nto monitor, visualise and ultimately predict their daily exposure to\npollutants. In addition the Home Assistant integration makes it simple\nto trigger actions based on their data. For example, flash a light in a\nuser\u2019s home or send them a notification, if the pollutant concentration\nrises. All that you need to make your own is a low cost micro-controller\nand a few readily available components.",
