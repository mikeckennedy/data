Will also demonstrate some sample codes and best practices that shows how to work as a software engineer in a data science company. Lastly, I will discuss how software engineers can shift to a more data science related job like a data engineer.\r\n\r\nOutline:\r\n\r\n- Intro: Data science vs software engineering\r\n- Challenges working with a data science team and how Python bridges the two domains\r\n- Common problems and solutions\r\n  - Development setup\r\n  - Performance considerations\r\n  - Deployment\r\n- Transitions from software engineering to data science\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 10:25:00 2020 at Curlyboi",
