  "description": "One of the core concepts of Application Development, (not just in\npython), is the separation between the Business Logic and the User\nInterface. However there is a strong temptation to start with the user\ninterface and add the business logic to it some methodologies emphasize\nthis with the process of prototyping the (G)UI first. The danger is that\nyour business logic code can get too entangled with the UI and a change\nof platform or framework becomes almost impossible.\n\nThis presentation will show how to maintain a clear separation between\nthe Business Logic and the User Interface by starting with a command\nline interface using argparse and growing a GUI on top.\n\nWe will cover: - Why maintain the seperation - Using argparse - Adding a\nGUI layer with wxPython - Automating the GUI generation - Adding a web\ninterface - Testing advantages of this approach - Scripting advantages -\nSome packaging models.\n\nSlides and Samples all uploaded to\nhttps://github.com/GadgetSteve/EP2018\\_Talk\n",
