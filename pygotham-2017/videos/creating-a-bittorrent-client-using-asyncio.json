  "description": "The purpose of this talk is explain the BitTorrent protocol and relevant Asyncio API used to create a BitTorrent client that can actually download a \".torrent\" file. The BitTorrent application will be built and presented as a set of steps (code snippets, i.e. coroutines) that implement various parts of the protocol and build up a final program that can download a file. Talk will cover,\n\n* Parsing a .torrent file\n* Connecting to a tracker\n* Establishing concurrent peer network connections using Asyncio\n* Torrent download strategy\n* Relevant Asyncio/event loop concepts where necessary\n\nAttendees need not know Asyncio and will learn the relevant functions needed to accomplish the task. No prior knowledge of the BitTorrent protocol is necessary either.",
