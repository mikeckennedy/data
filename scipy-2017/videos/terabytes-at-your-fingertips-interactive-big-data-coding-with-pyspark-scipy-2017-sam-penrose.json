  "description": "Effective programmers work in tight loops: make a small change to the code, run it, observe the effect, repeat. Sadly, we can't observe big distributed systems with print() or \"step.\" We'll learn how to find the root problem when our distributed code breaks and how to scale fixes back up to handle terabytes of data. Attendees will leave with a toolbox for increasing their productivity with large distributed systems.",
