  "description": "In today\u2019s fast-paced world, change is becoming more of a necessity than\na luxury. And yet, many of us, understandably, still have a love-hate\nrelationship with change. How comfortable is your comfort zone? Should\nyou take that step onto new, unknown territory? Once you do, can you\nconvince others to do the same? Learning how to answer questions like\nthese is crucial, if we want to truly innovate in our jobs, communities,\nand lives. In this talk, I\u2019d like to share some of the lessons that I\nlearned about inducing and managing change, both in myself and in groups\nI\u2019ve worked with as a documentation writer, Agile scrum master,\ncommunity manager, and diversity advocate. Magic solutions are not\nguaranteed, healthy discussions are encouraged.\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 20 April** at 09:45 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
