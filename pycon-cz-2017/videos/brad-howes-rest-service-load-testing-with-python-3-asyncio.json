  "description": "For a REST service we are deploying for a customer, we wished to know\nhow well it would perform under various load scenarios. Since we\nalready had a Python driver that understood the REST service, it was\nonly natural to attempt the load testing in Python as well. I will\ndiscuss the harness we used to generate load, and how and why we\nmodeled load as a Poisson process.",
