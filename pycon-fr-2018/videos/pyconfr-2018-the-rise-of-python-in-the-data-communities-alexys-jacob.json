  "description": "A retrospective and prospective of Python\u2019s adoption in the data-driven\nindustries and how it has and should influence its ecosystem and\ncommunities.\n\nThanks to its versatility, Python\u2019s usage and adoption has changed a lot\nover the last decade to go beyond the very act of software programming.\n\nFrom Developers to SysOps, closely followed by Scientists and Data\nanalysts, Python has spread to become a common tongue for a wide range\nof people.\n\nWe will start by looking at how this increased adoption impacted Python\necosystem and is still shaping it today. While this talk is not walk\nthrough all the Python technologies around data, some of them will be\noutlined so you will hear words like Numpy, Pandas or Jupyter.\n\nThen we will try to project ourselves in the future and by highlighting\nthe pitfalls Python has to overcome to keep up with its pace and mature\nin its ability to scale!\n",
