  "description": "Python is an opensource language that has a wide community, and nowadays\nthe biggest companies also create frameworks, libraries with Python and\nopen- sourced them. Tensorflow is the most used library in Deep Learning\nby researchers and there are many examples of various fields like\nComputer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Signal Processing.\n\nNowadays, Generative Adversarial Networks a.k.a. GAN collect nearly all\ninterests on it by the Computer Vision experts. There are diverse\napplications like image colorization, image generation from random\nnumbers, computer game character creation, face frontalization, face\nalignment, 2D to 3D image transfer, style transfer and so on.\n\nIn this talk, we are going to talk about GANs and the implementation\ndetails on Tensorflow which is backed by Google and has the power of\neither work on CPU and GPU.\n\nThe implementation of GANs can be divided into 2 parts. One is called\ngenerator and other is called discriminator. In this talk, the\ndifferences between the discriminator and generator also are mentioned.\n\nBesides, some various architecture of GANs like PGGAN, DCGAN, STARGAN,\narchitectures showed in Tensorflow code, which of these are not already\nimplemented in Tensorflow by the date now.\n\nThe session will be finished with showing some examples of outputs in\nface generation, room generation, and also live demo of the style\ntransfer implementation.\n\nin \\_\\_on **sabato 21 aprile** at 15:30 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
