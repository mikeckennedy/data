  "description": "In this talk I will describe a system that we've built for doing\nhierarchical text classification. I will describe the logical setup of\nthe various steps involved: data processing, feature selection,\ntraining, validation and labelling. To make this all work in practice\nwe've mapped the setup onto a Hadoop cluster. I'll discuss some of the\npro's and con's that we've run into when working with Python and Hadoop.\nFinally, I'll discuss how we use crowdsourcing to continuously improve\nthe quality of our hierarchical classifier.\n",
