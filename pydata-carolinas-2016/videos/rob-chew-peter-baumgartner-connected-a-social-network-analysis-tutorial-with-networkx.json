  "description": "Social Network Analysis (SNA), the study of the relational structure\nbetween actors, is used throughout the social and natural sciences to\ndiscover insight from connected entities. In this tutorial, you will\nlearn how to use the NetworkX library to analyze network data in\nPython, emphasizing intuition over theory.\n\nMethods will be illustrated using a dataset of the romantic\nrelationships between characters on \"Grey's Anatomy\", an American\nmedical drama on the ABC television network. Analysis and intuition\nwill be emphasized over theory and mathematical rigor. An\nIPython/Jupyter notebook format will be used as we code through the\nexamples together.",
