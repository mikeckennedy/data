  "description": "Security and Privacy issues need no introduction. But how exactly is\nthis affecting the field of Machine Learning? This is what this talk\nwill cover. We first expose the attack surface of systems deploying\nmachine learning. We then describe how an attacker may force models to\nmake wrong predictions with very little information about the victim.\nOne such attack can be biometric recognition where fake biometric traits\nmay be exploited to impersonate a legitimate user. We demonstrate that\nthese attacks are practical against existing machine learning as a\nservice platform. Towards the end, we will discuss current research to\ndefend models from such attacks.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1700\n\nin \\_\\_on **Saturday 4 May** at 11:30 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
