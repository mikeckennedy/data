  "description": "Cdiscount is the French leader on e-commerce, with millions of visitors\nand millions of products sold. But that is not all: Cdiscount is also a\ncompany where dozens of Data Scientists are daily challenged with a\nmassive amount of data coming from visitors, customers, its product\ncatalogue and internal search engine. Their goal: deliver performing and\ninnovating algorithms in a short delay. The Cdiscount\u2019s Data Science\nteams use Python for both prototyping and production, trying to shorten\nthe path between a research idea and its industrialization.\n\nIn this talk, we are going to present some examples of Python\napplications in Cdiscount and we are going to focus on one in\nparticular: the keyword clusterisation in Google Ads campaigns using the\nWord-2-Vec algorithm of the gensim package. The solution of this NLP\nproblem allows to use the signal of high-traffic keywords to predict the\nperformance of lower-traffic ones and improve the bidding.\n",
