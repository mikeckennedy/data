Also unlike some other languages, this repository, the Python Package Index, is entirely supported by the community and operated by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss why we have the PyPI we all know and love, and why the current status quo is preferred. We'll go a bit into how PyPI works, both from a technical perspective, and from the perspective as an open-source and non-profit project.\n\nFinally, we'll have a call to action to help improve, and more importantly sustain, this critical piece of Python infrastructure.\n\nAbout the speaker\nDustin is a Developer Advocate at Google, focused on supporting the Python community on Google Cloud. He's also a member of the Python Packaging Authority, maintainer of the Python Package Index, and organizer for the PyTexas conference.\n\nSponsor Acknowledgement\nThis and other PyBay2019 videos are via the help of our media partner AlphaVoice (https://www.alphavoice.io/)!\n\n#pybay #pybay2019 #python #python3 #gdb",
