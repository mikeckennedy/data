  "description": "Faster Python Programs Through Optimization\n\nMike M\u00c3\u00bcller\n\nAlthough Python programs may be slow for certain types of tasks, there\nare many different ways to improve performance. This tutorial will\nintroduce optimization strategies and demonstrate techniques to\nimplement them. Another of the objectives of this course is to give\nparticipants the ability to decide what might be the optimal solution\nfor a certain performance problem. Participants are strongly recommended\nto bring laptops because all techniques are introduced with examples and\nexercises.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nPython programmers with intermediate knowledge.\n\nClass Outline\n\n-  How Fast is Fast Enough?\n-  Optimization Guidelines\n\n   -  Premature optimization\n   -  Optimization rules\n   -  Seven steps for incremental optimization\n\n-  Optimization strategy\n\n   -  Measuring in stones\n   -  Profiling CPU usage\n   -  Profiling memory usage\n\n-  Algorithms and Anti-patterns\n\n   -  String Concatenation\n   -  List and Generator Comprehensions\n   -  The Right Data Structure\n   -  Caching\n\n-  The Example\n-  Testing Speed\n-  Pure Python\n-  Meet Psyco, the JIT\n-  Numpy for Numeric Arrays\n-  Using multiple CPUs with pyprocessing/multiprocessing\n-  Combination of optimization strategies\n-  Results of Different Example Implementations\n\nThe following third-party packages are needed:\n\n-  psyco (version 1.5.2 or higher)\n-  numpy (version 1.2 or higher)\n-  pyprocessing (2.5 or lower only)\n-  Guppy\\_PE framework\n\n",
