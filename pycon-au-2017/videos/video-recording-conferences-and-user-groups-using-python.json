  "description": "Ever wanted to video record a conference or user group - or attempted to, and groaned at how time consuming and error prone it seems to be? This talk will delve into some of the open-source Python automation and tools we've been using at events since 2009 (including Pycon Australia) to make this process much faster and easier, which allows video teams of volunteers to produce consistently high quality video.\n\nThe systems we use cover everything from pre-event preparation (schedule data, etc), the technology used at the event to live-mix video, and the post-production automation we use for encoding and programmatic uploading of video.\n\nIf you're interested in recording a local event near you, this talk will introduce you with some of the tools and processes we use to do the same.",
