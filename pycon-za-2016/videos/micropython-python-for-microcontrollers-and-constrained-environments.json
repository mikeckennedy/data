  "description": "MicroPython has risen from a kickstarter campaign to a feature rich\nimplementation of Python 3 on microcontrollers. The project is\nsummarized in the following statement: \"MicroPython is a lean and\nefficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that\nincludes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised\nto run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments\"\n(http://micropython.org/). With IOT gaining more momentum daily and\ndevices such as the ESP8266 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13678)\nnow able to serve web pages, MicroPython is a viable candidate for fast\nprototyping and simple embedded devices.\n\nThis talk will focus mainly on the ESP8266 & Unix implementation of\nMicroPython. The ESP8266 is an amazing device, considering it is the\nsize of a R5 coin and can run an implementation of Python. The talk will\ncover features, limitations and some simple ideas to get going. A demo\nof a simple Home Automation/IOT application with MicroPython & the\nESP8266 will also be included.\n\nThis talk aims to bring the familiarity of Python 3 to developers, with\nthe hope of encouraging hack-a-day type projects without extensive\nembedded device knowledge.\n",
