  "description": "How Python can be used in IoT/infrastructure automation tasks\n\nThe talk will be a getting start guide on controlling hardware devices with Python. We know Python users are very keen on multitasking and always wish to know more about how it can be used in different tasks. This talk will help audiences exploring new Python skillset. Audiences may be inspired by this talk and apply it to many scenarios, e.g., IoT and infrastructure automation.\r\n\r\nIntended audiences include:\r\n1. wish to know how Python can be used beyond data analysis and web dev\r\n2. a Pythonista who interested in craft some touchable things \r\n3. want to acquire something new into your Python skillset\r\n\r\nAudiences are expected to have basic knowledge about:\r\n1. Python syntax and control flow\r\n2. Computer and operating system (especially UNIX)\r\n\r\nAfter this talk, audiences will have:\r\n1. The basic idea of controlling devices with Python\r\n2. Expanding their Python skillset. Know how to use Python in another interesting and useful task besides ML, web scrapping, etc.",
