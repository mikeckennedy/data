Performing these transformations on large datasets can be\neven more daunting, as the number of areas that could have been affected.\nThe number of areas to troubleshoot can be numerous, making it time-\nconsuming to identify the root cause to be fixed.\n\nInstead of going through a manual checklist of data points and features to\ncheck, this talk will walk through a framework for how you can readily apply\ntesting to ensure that any data transformations we make are accurate, and\n\nThis talk is for anyone working with datasets where maintaining the quality\nof our data i",
