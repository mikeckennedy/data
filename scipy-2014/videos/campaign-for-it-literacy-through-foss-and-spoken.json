  "description": "The FOSSEE team has been promoting the use of FOSS in educational\ninstitutions in India. It focuses on the following FOSS systems\ncurrently: Scilab, Python, Oscad, OpenFOAM, COIN-OR and OpenFormal\n(http://fossee.in). On each of these systems, the following three\nstandardised help are provided:\n\n1. Support to conduct spoken tutorial based workshops, explained below\n2. Creation of Textbook Companion (TBC)\n3. Support to Lab Migration.\n\nA TBC is a collection of code for solved examples of standard textbooks.\nWe have completed a large number of TBCs on Scilab and made them\navailable for online use at `Scilab <http://cloud.scilab.in/>`__ and\noffline use at `Completed\nBooks <http://www.scilab.in/Completed_Books>`__. Similarly, one may\naccess the Python TBC at `Python TBC <http://tbc-python.fossee.in/>`__.\nThese TBCs are created by students and teachers from many colleges and\neach creator is paid an honorarium through a project funded by the\nGovernment of India.\n\n`Spoken Tutorial <http://spoken-tutorial.org>`__ is a screencast of ten\nminute duration on a FOSS topic, created for self learning. Using Spoken\nTutorials, we conduct two hour long workshops on FOSS topics through\nvolunteers, who need not be experts. We conduct online tests and provide\ncertificates for all who pass the tests. All of these are done\ncompletely free of cost, thanks to the financial support from the\nGovernment of India. Using this method, we have trained more than 200K\nstudents in the last two years in India\n(`statistics <http://www.spoken-tutorial.org/statistics>`__).\n\nThe students love this method, see some testimonials at\nhttp://www.spoken-tutorial.org/testimonials. It is being increasingly\naccepted by colleges and universities, officially. We expect to conduct\n5K to 10K workshops in 2014, training 200K to 500K students. As we dub\nthe spoken part into all 22 languages of India, the FOSS topics are\naccessible also to students who are not fluent in English, thereby\nhelping us reach out to many students. Spoken Tutorial, which started as\na documentation project for FOSS systems has transformed into a massive\ntraining programme. Our methods are scalable and are available to the\nFOSS enthusiasts in the rest of the world.\n",
