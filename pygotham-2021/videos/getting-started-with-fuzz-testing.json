  "description": "Is your project safe against unforeseen scenarios? Are you sure? How about\nif we take it for a ride then? There is almost no software completely error\nfree. And catch all of the possible errors is hard, not to say almost\nimpossible, but what if we use tools that help us bring possible issues to\nour attention? Those that might cause security issues, or bad user\nexperience.\n\nIn this presentation I'll discuss how to get started with fuzz testing: The\nart of hitting software with invalid, unexpected, or random data and seeing\nhow it reacts. I'll present valid scenarios for fixing the bugs found, some\nof the existing tools, and how to integrate fuzz testing with our existing\ntests.",
