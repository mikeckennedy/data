  "description": "The session is divided into two parts, of roughly 2 hours each. People\nwho are interested only in the first part, can leave the session after\nit. However, the first part is a prerequisite for the second one, thus\npeople are not advised to join in the middle of the session.\n\nThe session is meant to be highly interactive. People are invited to\nbring their own laptop and try things by themselves.\n\nPart 1: Run your application under PyPy\n---------------------------------------\n\nThis tutorial is targeted to Python users who want to run their favorite\nPython application under PyPy, and exploit the most of it. The following\ntopics will be covered:\n\n::\n\n    - how to fix/avoid CPython implementation details (e.g., refcounting)\n\n    - general overview of how the PyPy JIT works\n\n    - how to optimize your program for the PyPy JIT\n\n    - how to view and interpret the traces produced by the JIT\n\n    - how to tweak the parameters of the JIT and the GC\n\n    - how to use existing CPython C extensions on PyPy, and fix them if necessary\n\nPart 2: Write your own interpreter with PyPy\n--------------------------------------------\n\nPyPy is not only a Python interpreter, but also a toolchain to implement\ndynamic languages. This tutorial is targeted to people who want to\nimplement their own programming languages, or who simply want to know\nmore about how the PyPy JIT works internally.\n\nThe students will be given the source code for a toy language\nimplemented in RPython. They will learn:\n\n::\n\n    - how to translate it to C using the PyPy translation toolchain\n\n    - what are the \"hints\" needed by the JIT generator, and how to place them\n\nThen, they will be challenged to add the proper hints to the toy\ninterpreter, to get the best result with the JIT.\n\n**THINGS TO DO BEFORE THE TRAINING**\n\nYou are encouraged to bring your laptop to the training session.\n\nMake sure that the following prerequisites are met:\n\n-  Install PyPy 1.5:\n\n   -  http://pypy.org/download.html\n\n   -  http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#installing-pypy\n\n-  Make sure that ``setuptools`` or ``distribute`` are installed (look\n   at the URL above for instructions)\n\n-  Clone the pypy repository, and update to the 1.5 version:\n\n$ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy\n\n$ cd pypy\n\n$ hg up -r release-1.5\n\n-  Clone the jitviewer repository and install it on pypy:\n\n$ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/pypy/jitviewer\n\n$ cd jitviewer\n\n$ /path/to/pypy-1.5/bin/pypy setup.py develop\n\nIf you intend to follow also the second part (\"Write your own\ninterpreter with PyPy\"), you need to make sure you have a working\n`developing\nenvironment <http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/getting-started-python.html%20#translating-the-pypy-python-interpreter>`__\n",
