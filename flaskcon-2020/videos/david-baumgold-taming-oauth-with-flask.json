  "description": "Many well-known APIs use OAuth for authentication, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub. OAuth is a notoriously complicated protocol, but you can't use any of these APIs without it. In this talk, we'll learn how OAuth works and why it's so complicated. We'll also use the Flask-Dance library to write a demo application that can authenticate with an API via OAuth. By the end, you'll be ready to tackle any OAuth API you want!",
