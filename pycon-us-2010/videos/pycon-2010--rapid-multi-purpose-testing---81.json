  "description": "Rapid multi-purpose testing\n\nPresented by Holger Krekel\n\nWant to rapidly test code, javascript or documents on different Python\nInterpreters and versions? This talk gives an overview on new py.test\nfeatures of the last year. I'll discuss the minimal-boilerplate testing\nand new plugin model and give an overview on which testing needs are\ncovered so far, for example:\n\n-  run tests written for nose or unittest\n-  ad-hoc distribute tests to local or remote Python environments\n-  test compatibility with Python3\n-  run javascript unit-tests in real browsers\n-  coverage testing\n-  django-specific testing\n\nI'll conclude with upcoming features regarding testing-in-the-cloud and\nplans on more test tool convergence.
