  "description": "There is no want of technologies for doing scientific calculations in\nPython. In this talk I will share some hard-learned knowledge about what\nworks and what doesn\u2019t with the libraries we are using at GEM (the\nGlobal Earthquake Model foundation). I will show how the following\nlibraries fare with respect to our main concerns of performance,\nsimplicity, reliability and portability\n\n-  h5py\n-  celery/rabbitmq\n-  PyZMQ\n-  numpy/scipy\n-  rtree\n\nand I will talk about several library bugs we found and had to work\naround. I will also talk about some libraries that we do not use (such\nas cython, numba, dask, pytables, \u2026) and the reason why we do not use\nthem. Hopefully this will be useful to people using or planning to use a\nsimilar software stack.\n\nMy slides are here: https://gitpitch.com/micheles/papers/europython2018\n",
