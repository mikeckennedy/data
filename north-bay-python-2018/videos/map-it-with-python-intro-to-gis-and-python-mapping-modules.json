  "abstract": "Maps are cool and so is Python! It turns out they play well together\ntoo.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll learn about modern map making and the Geographic\nInformation that powers it, as well as some of Python\u2019s open source\nmapping libraries: geopandas, matplotlib, shapely, seaborn, and fiona.\nThen we\u2019ll go through a fun mapping example together. No need for\nexpensive mapping software, we\u2019ll have everything we need in a Jupyter\nNotebook.\n\nYou\u2019ll leave this talk with a new-found love for maps and the power to\nmake your own. Happy mapping!\n",
