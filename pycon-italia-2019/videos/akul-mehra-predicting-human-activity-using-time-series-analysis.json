  "description": "Time series is referred to as sequence of data points measured over\nsuccessive intervals of time. Time series analysis is performed to\nextract meaningful statistics and characteristics of the data. For\nexample, this analysis can be used to predict future based on the past\nevents. Such use cases of this analysis are stock market prediction,\nweather prediction and web traffic prediction.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll be understanding the basics and how to perform time\nseries analysis and machine learning for a given dataset. For this talk,\nwe\u2019ll be using the UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Data Set to\nclassify a given activity performed by the human as one of the following\nactivities: Walking, Sitting, Standing or Laying.\n\nThe talk would be intermediate level and basics of Python and Pandas are\nrequired. Understanding of Machine Learning algorithms and signal\nprocessing would be helpful.\n\nFeedback form: https://python.it/feedback-1576\n\nin \\_\\_on **Saturday 4 May** at 18:00 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
