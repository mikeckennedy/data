  "description": "Everyone\u2019s talking about it. Everyone\u2019s using it. But most likely, they\u2019re doing it wrong, just like we did. By building a simplified chaos monkey service, we will walk through how to create a good foundation for an asyncio-based service, including graceful shutdowns, proper exception handling, and testing asynchronous code. We\u2019ll get into the hairier topics as well, covering topics like working with synchronous code, debugging and profiling, and working with threaded code. We\u2019ll learn how to approach asynchronous and concurrent programming with Python\u2019s asyncio library, take away some best practices, and learn what pitfalls to avoid.",
