  "description": "Asyncio is a fairly new tool and no often used in production. In this talk we will be aiming for use-cases and examples so people can get more confidence moving away from the synchronous world. The talk aims to solve the problem of uncertainty when getting started with asynchronous programming in Python. After the talk the audience will be equipped with new tools they can look up at home to get started with asynchronous web development in Python, also, hopefully, they will have some extra confidence in the area.",
