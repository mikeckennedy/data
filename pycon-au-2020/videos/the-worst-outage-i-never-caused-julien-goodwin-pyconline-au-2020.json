  "description": "Julien Goodwin\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/VKMUTH\n\nIn 2017 I came one keypress from causing Google's main backbone to largely fall off the Internet. This is the story of how we used that incident as a learning opportunity, how a lack of buy-in hindered further improvements, and how an existing toolkit of python libraries allowed testing and validation tools to be quickly built, preventing any chance of a recurrence.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 16:35:00 2020 at Obvious",
