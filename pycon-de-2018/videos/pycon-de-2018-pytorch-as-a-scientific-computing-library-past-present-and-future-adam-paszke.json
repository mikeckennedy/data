  "description": "Python is very well known for its ecosystem of mature scientific\ncomputing packages.

Although originally they were meant to provide better support\nfor those domain specific use cases, one can come to a conclusion, that\nthey can actually have wider applications.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll showcase the main ideas behind PyTorch - a relatively\nnew library focusing on usability and good integration with other Python\npackages. I\u2019ll cover some interesting use cases, ranging from ones more\nspecific to machine learning, to those more generally applicable in\nother scientific computing areas. I\u2019ll also cover some recently added\nfeatures, and talk a bit about our future roadmap.\n",
