  "description": "Exploring the power of class-based views, their current status and how\nthe concepts behind them can be applied to other areas.\n\nAbstract\n\nGeneric views are quickly outgrown for all but the most simple of\napplications. They are often rewritten from scratch just to make small\nchanges to functionality.\n\nIf you use class-based views, code can be reused by inheriting from more\nabstract views. They are provided with many reusable applications, but\nall implemented in slightly different ways. It has been suggested a set\nof views be supplied with Django to standardise the API.\n\nI will present some of the advantages and disadvantages of using\nclass-based views, and how they can help you develop more flexible\napplications in less time.\n",
