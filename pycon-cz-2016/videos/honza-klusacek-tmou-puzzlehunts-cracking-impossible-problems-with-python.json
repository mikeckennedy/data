  "description": "Do you like codes, riddles and ciphers? Some people have turned\ncracking puzzles into a hobby and gave rise to events dedicated to\nsolving such problems \u2013 puzzlehunts. TMOU is the oldest and biggest\none among them. During these games, players regularly feel the\nfrustration from endless unsuccessful efforts, often quickly followed\nby extraordinary joy after finally figuring out the peculiar problem.\nThis joy can only be surpassed by creating a perfect puzzle for\nothers to solve.\n\nI will share a few lessons learnt while organizing TMOU, namely:\n\n- What makes a problem seemingly impossible\n- How to turn impossible into possible and hard into not-so-hard\n- How to crack tough problems and hammer down their complexity\n- Why Python might be a good hammer for that\n\nFollow the creation of a specific puzzle from an initial idea to the\nfinal design (puzzle #4 \"the Dice\", TMOU 17\nhttp://www.tmou.cz/2015/sifry/reseni#kostka). Where else would you\nneed to solve a bunch of problems just to create a new one?",
