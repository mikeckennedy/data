  "description": "Scikit-learn traditionally centered its data model around numpy arrays.\nHowever, in an important subset of scikit-learn's use cases, the\noriginal data in the machine learning pipeline is tabular:\nheterogeneously typed and labeled. In the meantime, pandas has become\nvery popular, and increasingly used to represent such tabular data, but\nscikit-learn does not always play well with heterogeneous DataFrames.\nThis talk will give an overview of the challenges and current\nbottlenecks when working with tabular data and scikit- learn. Then it\nwill show the ungoing developments in sckikit-learn to improve this\nsituation and highlight some third-party libraries that try to ease\nthose problems.Presenter(s): Speaker: Joris Van den Bossche, Universit\u00e9\nParis-Saclay Center for Data Science\n",
