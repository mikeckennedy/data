  "description": "There are many deployment options for Python code. I'll share what has\nworked well for me on Windows, packaging command line tools and services\nusing py2exe and InnoSetup. I'll demonstrate a simple build script which\ncreates windows binaries and an InnoSetup installer in one step. In\naddition, I'll go over common errors which come up when using py2exe and\nhints on troubleshooting them. This is a short talk, so there will be a\nfollow-up Open Space session to share experience and help each other\nsolve distribution problems.\n",
