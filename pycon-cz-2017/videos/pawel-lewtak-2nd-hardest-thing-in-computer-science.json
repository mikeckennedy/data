  "description": "Have you heard about the two hardest things in computer science? It's\ncache invalidation and naming things. I want to focus on the second\none.\n\nLet's see common examples of both good and bad naming. What's the\ncommon part of each of them? What's makes names good? Can we settle\non good enough or should we aim for perfect names? I'll show some of\nbest and bad practices so you'll be able to recognize both of them\nwhen you make code review for your peers. Naming is one of two\nhardest things in CS, so I don't claim to be right about everything\nbut I'm open to discussion and happy to learn from you as well.",
