Why does facial recognition see me as a child? These are all valid questions I often ask myself as I navigate my weird and different world. Have you heard the phrase \u201cYou have to be this tall for Micro-services\u201d? well what about: \u201cYou have to be this tall to operate a mobile phone?\u201d. I am finding it harder and harder to reach any button except for \u201c#\u201d and \u201c9\u201d.\r\n\r\nBuilding accessibility into the planning stages of programming can eliminate barriers for participation and create an inclusive environment for people with disabilities. Programming for diversity serves as an unquestionable indicator that your software embraces the diversity of your users and cares about their safety and comfort.\r\n\r\nJoin me on a fascinating and thought-provoking look at how you can program for Accessibility with Python.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 16:00:00 2020 at Obvious",
