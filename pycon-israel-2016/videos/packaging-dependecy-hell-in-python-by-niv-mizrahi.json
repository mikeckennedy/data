  "description": "In this talk we will discuss packing, dependencies and deploying apps in python. We all love python, The syntax is simple and expressive, it has tons of open source modules and frameworks and a great community. \n\nHowever one of pythons biggest pitfalls is the lack of clear way for deploying python apps. We will discuss and show packaging, dependency management and deployment solutions in Python. The talk will be separated to four short parts: \n\n1. Python packaging pitfalls \n2. What can python learn from NPM \n3. Our current solutions: from DEB/RPM to docker \n4. What new in python 3.X and packaging (venv, ensurepip, zipapp)\n\nSlides available here: http://il.pycon.org/2016/static/sessions/niv-mizrahi.pdf",
