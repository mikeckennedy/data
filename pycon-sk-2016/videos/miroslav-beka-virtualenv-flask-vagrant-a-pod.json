  "description": "Large organizations have traditionally used languages such as C ++, .NET\nand Java development for enterprise applications. \"Scripting\" languages\nlike Python were considered risky. Not sufficiently robust with the lack\nof the tools around them (framework). Times have, however, changed and\nthe Python language has become surrounded by the huge open source\ncommunity that takes care of the maintenance of the ecosystem. We see\nincreasing use of dynamic languages for web applications development.\nBut what is meant by productive enterprise or web application? These\napplications should meet several requirements. Scalability, zero down\ntime deployments, short release cycles and many other properties\n",
