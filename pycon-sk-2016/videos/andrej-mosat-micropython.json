  "description": "Micropython is a minimal implementation of Python 3 on embedded\nprocessors like ARM, x86. It allows developers to quickly and\neffectively write code directly for hardware without the need for\ncompiling.\n\nThe advantage of an interpreted language is mainly in removing the\ncompilation time. Errors appear when executing the program, the response\nis immediate. The disadvantages include an increased demand for memory\nand unscheduled pause due to the garbage collector. I will introduce\ndevelopment platforms running interpreted languages, their advantages\nand disadvantages.\n\nThe main part of the lecture will be devoted to basic hardware\ndevelopment using examples such as switches, LEDs, potentiometers and\ninterruptions.\n",
