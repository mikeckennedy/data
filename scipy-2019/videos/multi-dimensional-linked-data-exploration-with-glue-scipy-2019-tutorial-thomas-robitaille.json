  "description": "We have developed an open-source multi-disciplinary Python package named glue (http://glueviz.org) that allows users to explore relationships within and across related datasets, making it easy for them to create multi-dimensional linked visualizations of datasets, select subsets of data interactively or programmatically in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions, and to see those selections propagate live across all open visualizations of the data (e.g., graphs, maps, diagnostics charts, etc.). In this tutorial, participants will learn how to use and customize the desktop and Jupyter version of glue, using example data as well as their own data.",
