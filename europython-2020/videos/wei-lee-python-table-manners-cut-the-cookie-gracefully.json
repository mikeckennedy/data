  "description": "A Guideline Toward Cleaner Code\n\n### Goals\r\nI expect the audiences to gain knowledge of the tools I mention and the primary usage of them. The tools will cover various aspects of software engineering (e.g., dependencies, testing, security, etc.). Also, I'll purpose how I combine all these tools in my development workflow as a sample for how the audiences can integrate these tools into their workflow.\r\n\r\n### Outline for 30 minutes\r\n* Dependency Management (4 min)\r\n* Testing - Don't let your customer debug for you (4 min)\r\n* Style Check and auto-fix (4 min)\r\n* Task Management - No more repetitive typing (3 min)\r\n* pre-commit - Prevent committing bad code into codebase (3 min)\r\n* commitizen-tool - How good commit message can help (4 min)\r\n* Security (3 min)\r\n* Cookiecutter - Wrap up all the tools (3 min)\r\n* Q & A (2 min)\r\n\r\n### Outline for 45 minutes\r\n* Dependency Management (5 min)\r\n* Testing - Don't let your customer debug for you (5 min)\r\n* Style Check and auto-fix (5 min)\r\n* Task Management - No more repetitive typing (5 min)\r\n* pre-commit - Prevent committing bad code into codebase (5 min)\r\n* commitizen-tool - How good commit message can help (5 min)\r\n* Security (5 min)\r\n* Continuous Integration - Assemble all the trivial steps (5 min)\r\n* Cookiecutter - Wrap up all the tools (3 min)\r\n* Q & A (2 min)",
