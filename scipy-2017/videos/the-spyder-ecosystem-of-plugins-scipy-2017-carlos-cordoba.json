  "description": "In this talk we want to introduce to the community a new set of third-party Spyder plugins (developed during the last six months) that extend the program functionality in interesting and novel ways. These plugins are: a *Notebook* plugin, that integrates the classic Jupyter notebook in Spyder; a *Reports* plugin, that allows users to write documents in markdown, with embedded code snippets and graphics, and export them to HTML and PDF; a *Terminal* plugin, that integrates system terminals in Spyder; and a *Vim* plugin, that allows using the most common Vim keybindings in Spyder's editor.",
