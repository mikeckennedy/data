  "description": "The ability to modify text programmatically through simple scripting can\nempower writers to make creative choices which would otherwise be\nimpossible.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss why it is useful for the gender of\ncharacters in a live action roleplaying game scenario to be an easily\nchangeable property, and introduce\n`Genderiser <https://bitbucket.org/confluence/genderiser>`__, a Python\nscript which is intended to assist non-technical writers in utilising\nthis technique in their own work.\n\nThe talk is aimed at anyone who is interested in applying their\nprogramming skills to creative writing. I hope to encourage beginners to\nuse Genderiser and adapt it to their own needs\u2014whether they are creating\na similar type of interactive fiction, or more traditional works such as\nnovels or short stories.\n\nThere will also be a more technical overview of how the script works,\nand how I have attempted to distribute it in a form which is useful to\nnon-technical users. I will also discuss future directions for the code,\nsuch as the addition of a graphical interface and use of better\npackaging and installation tools.\n",
