  "description": "This talk will take a look at how Django could look if it was designed from the ground up as an ASGI framework. We\u2019ll examine how we could approach this design in a way that helps reduce tight coupling and framework complexity, and take a look at what new capabilities this would provide.\nThis talk sketches out how a redesign of Django might look, if it was reworked as an ASGI web framework. It draws on the design work behind the Starlette web framework and the Uvicorn web server.\n",
