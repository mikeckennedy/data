  "description": "Join us for a Phileas Fogg inspired whirlwind tour of eight Python web\nframeworks.\n\n\u201cHad he programmed? It was likely, for no one seemed to know web\nframeworks more familiarly; there was no framework so obscure that he\ndid not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it. He must have\ndeveloped in everything, at least in the spirit.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the current crop of microframeworks, showing how to\nachieve the same task in each, before progressing to \u201cBatteries\nincluded\u201d and the more specialised async frameworks.\n\nFor developers who perhaps have only used a single framework, this talk\ngives them an opportunity to get out and explore the world (of web\nframeworks) and broaden their horizons, with plenty of Jules Verne\ninspired fun along the way.\n",
