  "description": "Sarcastic talk, sharing real-life experience on both technical and\nsocial aspects of doing an architecture migration to microservices\nwithout losing a job.\n\nAny change in software architecture is a significant time investment.\nWriting microservices in Python is a joy, but when you decide on it,\nthere is often no way back. Therefore it is always an advantage to know\nwhat to expect in advance, not just from inspiring blog posts but also\nfrom the harsh reality.\n\nI would like to share typical pitfalls of choosing a framework stack,\ncommunication protocol, conventions, and deployment process \u2014 all\ncovered by real projects.",
