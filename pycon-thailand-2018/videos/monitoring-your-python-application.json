  "description": "Application Performance Monitoring (APM) is a solution built on Elastic Stack. APM helps you to build/store data points in Elasticsearch and visualize. It automatically collects information from your python application/service.\nThis talk mainly targets at introducing the solution, why it is needed and what you can do with data. It ends with once data is stored within Elasticsearch, what else you can use (ex. Infrastructure Monitoring, Machine Learning).\n\n\n\n--------\n\nAravind is a loquacious person, who has something to talk about everything.
