  "description": "In this talk I would like to focus more on how language processing is\nmade easier using python tool kits. How can we set up pipeline\nstarting from scratch to the specific solution using Python tools. I\nhave been using python from last 5-6 years and my main area of\nresearch is language processing and information retrieval. I have used\npython tools previously on various projects and problems related to\nSentiment analysis, Text processing, Summarization , Classification\netc. For details you can check out my profile http://computing.dcu.ie/~parora/.\n\nI would like to talk about main 2 aspects:\n\n1. Based Raw Text processing: using NLTK toolkit and other plugins\n2. Deep learning: using Gensim toolkit\n\nDepending on the time availability I would like to have some hands-on\nexperience or have some live coding to make the talk interactive.\n\nDuring my PhD and collaborative projects with researchers and\nindustries I have discovered sometime starting from scratch seems\nquite complicated and can take lots of time and resources, but how can\nwe speed up that process and focus on the main innovative solution is\nthe main key resources, which I would like to address and discuss.\n",
