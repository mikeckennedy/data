  "description": "Mobile apps are the hot item of the day - and the best mobile apps are\nbacked by a great website. Python web developer Nate Aune and iPhone\ndeveloper Anna Callahan will show you how we built a simple music web\napp in Django with a native iPhone app that communicates with it.\nAttendees of this talk will see a concrete case study of building an\napplication that exposes an API for mobile devices.\n\nOur web app exposes a JSON API for sending and receiving data from the\nmobile device. We\u2019ll talk about why we chose Django and the TastyPie API\npackage, and discuss other Python-based frameworks that could be used to\nbuild the API such as Pyramid, Flask and Bottle. We\u2019ll also compare REST\nand custom APIs to understand best practices for building APIs designed\nfor mobile devices.\n",
