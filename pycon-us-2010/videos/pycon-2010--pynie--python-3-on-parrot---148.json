  "description": "Pyine: Python 3 on Parrot\n\nPresented by Allison Randal\n\nPynie is an implementation of Python 3 on Parrot. The goal of Pynie is\nto duplicate the pure-Python behavior of CPython 3.x, and perhaps\neventually a C API compatibility layer. Parrot provides a set of\ncompiler tools and core functionality common to many dynamic languages,\nso the core code of Pynie is lightweight. Pynie allows Python 3\nlibraries to be shared between multiple languages. This talk is an\noverview of the features Pynie currently supports and the work left to\nbe done, together with an introduction to the internals of Pynie.\n",
