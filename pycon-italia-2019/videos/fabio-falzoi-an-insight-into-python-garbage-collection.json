  "description": "The talk will describe Python garbage collection, specifically the\nCPython strategy. Various examples will demonstrate its peculiarities\nand the related impact in term of performance. Whenever feasible, the\nrelevant piece of the actual CPython source code will be presented and\nexplained. Finally, the talk will focus on some comparisons with\nalternative language implementation (such as PyPy) or other languages\ngarbage collectors (Golang). A mid-level experience with the Python\nlanguage is required. A very basic knowledge of both C and GO\nprogramming languages will help to understand some examples regarding\nCPython and Go, but it is not essential.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1767\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 3 May** at 18:00 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
