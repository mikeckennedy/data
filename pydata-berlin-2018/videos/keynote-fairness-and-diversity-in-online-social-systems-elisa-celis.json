  "abstract": "Social systems are now fueled by algorithms that facilitate and control\nconnections and information. Simultaneously, computational systems are\nnow fueled by people -- their interactions, data, and behavior.\nConsequently, there is a pressing need to design new algorithms that are\nsocially responsible in how they learn, and socially optimal in the\nmanner in which they use information. Recently, we have made initial\nprogress in addressing such problems at this interface of social and\ncomputational systems. In this talk, we will first understand the\nemergence of bias in data and algorithmic decision making and present\nfirst steps towards developing a systematic framework to control biases\nin classical problems such as data summarization and personalization.\nThis work leads to new algorithms that have the ability to alleviate\nbias and increase diversity while often simultaneously maintaining their\ntheoretical or empirical performance with respect to the original\nmetrics.\n",
