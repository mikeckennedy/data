  "description": "The Zen of Python, accessed by running ``import this``, is a list of\nnineteen aphorisms that have guided the development of the language. It\nhas good advice for how to organize our code, but what does it have to\nsay about how we organize ourselves? Plenty: the Zen of Python is not\nonly a solid set of development principles, but the other easter egg is\nthat it\u2019s packed with wisdom about how to build healthy teams.\n\nIn this talk I draw upon my time as an engineering manager of\nPython-focused engineering teams to tell stories of what the Zen of\nPython has to teach us about communication and conflict, building\ninclusive teams and transparent processes, and promoting psychological\nsafety. Come ready to reflect on and feel inspired by a new\ninterpretation of these principles, and bring what you learn back to\nyour meetup, study group, open source project, or team.\n",
