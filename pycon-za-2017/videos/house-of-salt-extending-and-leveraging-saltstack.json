  "description": "Once upon a time, sysadmins had cute naming schemes for their boxen,\nand it was good. Suddenly, virtualisation! And the cute names\nwithered as herds of servers were born. Infrastructure automation and\nmanagement became a thing. Helper software was released (without\nwhich a nine person company could not hope to manage 400-odd\nservers.) And it was good again, until the edges showed. Then we\nstarted to build.\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll discuss the challenges encountered in managing\nhundreds of servers delivering a single product on AWS. Relying on\nSaltStack for deployment, management and diagnostics, we\u2019ve automated\naway painful steps and reduced our attack surface. SaltStack handles\nconfiguration and package management well, but is capable of much more\nonce you start to customise it.\n\nAlong the way we\u2019ll show examples of custom SaltStack modules, runners,\nand event handlers. We\u2019ll describe threats and show how SaltStack helps\nus limit their exposure and impact. We\u2019ll catalogue the lessons we\u2019ve\nfaced in two years of running SaltStack in our production environment.\n\nWe won't rehash content from previous talks, and novice users will get\nto see how the tool can be stretched. If you\u2019re wanting to get more out\nof SaltStack than the builtin modules allow for, this talk is for you.\n",
