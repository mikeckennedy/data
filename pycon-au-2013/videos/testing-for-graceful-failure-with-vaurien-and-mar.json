  "summary": "So you've built an awesome webapp, put it through its paces, and assured\nyourself that it does what it's supposed to do. Great! Now how does it\nbehave when things start to go wrong?\n\nThis talk will demonstrate how the Mozilla Services team tests for\nfailure scenarios in our web services, focusing on two key python-based\ntools: Marteau, a web-based frontend for easily running load-tests and\nanalyzing the results, and Vaurien, a misbehaving TCP proxy that can\nsimulate a variety of backend failure modes.\n\nUsed together, these tools can help ensure that a web service will not\nonly scale up to meet its expected demand, but will fail gracefully when\nit finally reaches breaking point.\n",
