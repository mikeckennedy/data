  "description": "This talk aims to lift the lid on the system that governs how types\nbehave in Python - everything except Metaclasses.\n\nThe talk answers questions such as:\n\n-  What is a class, and how can we think of them?\n-  How are classes instantiated?\n-  How are attributes obtained from a class or an instance?\n-  Why do I get a different thing when accessing a method via its class\n   instead of its instance?\n-  How do the classmethod and staticmethod decorators work?\n-  How can I modify classes and instances after they've been\n   initialised?\n-  Does any of this allow me to do any clever tricks?\n\nAttendees should understand at least the basics of object oriented\nprogramming in Python. This talk doesn't aim to explain\nobject-orientation, o-o design, or how Python represents objects in C.\n",
