Computers will not complain about how you write it (except correct syntax), but human readers will. This talk is about writing clear code and caring for the human beings that will read it. Yourself included.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/GSG7KQ\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
