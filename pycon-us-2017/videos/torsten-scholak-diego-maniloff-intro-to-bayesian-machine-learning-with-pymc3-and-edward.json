  "description": "There has been uprising of probabilistic programming and Bayesian\nstatistics. These techniques are tremendously useful, because they help\nus to understand, to explain, and to predict data through building a\nmodel that accounts for the data and is capable of synthesizing it. This\nis called the generative approach to statistical pattern recognition.\n\nEstimating the parameters of Bayesian models has always been hard,\nimpossibly hard actually in many cases for anyone but experts. However,\nrecent advances in probabilistic programming have endowed us with tools\nto estimate models with a lot of parameters and for a lot of data. In\nthis tutorial, we will discuss two of these tools, PyMC3 and Edward.\nThese are black box tools, swiss army knifes for Bayesian modeling that\ndo not require knowledge in calculus or numerical integration. This puts\nthe power of Bayesian statistics into the hands of everyone, not only\nexperts of the field. And, it's great that these are implemented in\nPython with its rich, beginner-friendly ecosystem. It means we can\nimmediately start playing with it...\n\nWe have planned three awesome parts, spread over three awesome hours:\n\n-  First hour: Introduction to Bayesian machine learning.\n\n-  Second hour: Baby steps in PyMC3 and Edward.\n\n-  Third hour: Solve a real-world problem with PyMC3 or Edward (model,\n   fit, criticize).\n",
