  "abstract": "There's a large body of research on machine learning-based dialogue, but\nmost voice and chat systems in production are still implemented using a\nstate machine and a set of rules.\n\nRasa NLU & Rasa Core are the leading open source libraries for building\nmachine learning-based chatbots and voice assistants.\n\nIn this workshop we will live-code a useful, engaging conversational AI\nbot based entirely on machine learning. We will start with language\nunderstanding, bootstrapping from very little annotated training data.\nYou will then go on to build up your bot's ability to handle\nincreasingly complex dialogues through supervised and interactive\nlearning. What will attendees learn:\n\n-  deep dive into the Rasa NLU and Rasa Core open source libraries\n-  fundamentals of natural language understanding and dialogue\n   management for building intelligent assistants\n-  overview of widely used algorithms\n-  good ways to manage training data\n\nThe code used in this tutorial can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-workshop-pydata-berlin\n",
