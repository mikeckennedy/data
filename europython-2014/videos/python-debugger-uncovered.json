  "summary": "This talk will explain how to implement a debugger for Python. We'll\nstart with setting a simple trace function, then look how it is\nimplemented in modern IDEs like PyCharm and Pydev. Then we go further in\nthe details and uncover the tricks used to implement some cool features\nlike exception handling and multiprocess debugging.\n",
