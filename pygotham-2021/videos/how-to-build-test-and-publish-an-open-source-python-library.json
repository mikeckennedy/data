The\nsecret to managing this many packages is comprehensive automation powered by\nGitHub Actions.\n\nI'll show you how to use cookiecutter, pytest and GitHub Actions to develop a new Python library, add tests, run continuous\nintegration and automatically  publish new releases of\nyour package to PyPI.\n\n[Detailed notes to accompany this talk](https://github.com/simonw/pygotham-packaging)",
