  "description": "As software engineers we're fundamentally builders. Whether its for\nbusiness or just as a hobby, we set out to solve problems through code.\nSentry is another story of that simple idea, but one that has continued\nover the better part of a decade. We'll talk about how Sentry was\nstarted as an unambitious side project and grew into the open source,\nventure-backed business it is today. Additionally we'll cover what it's\ntaken to build a company as an extremely technical software engineer,\nincluding lessons learned along the way.\n",
