  "description": "Scaling systems is hard, but we\u2019re developers \u2014 that\u2019s kind of our thing. Scaling people? Well, that\u2019s significantly harder. Humans are complicated.  \n\nBroadly speaking, companies have three stages of development: infancy, those awkward teenage years and \u2014 if they survive the trials of adolescence \u2014 adulthood. An infant startup is so drastically different from its adult incarnation that they can be considered different companies. Each will have a unique mission and culture. \n\nScaling isn\u2019t just about making what you have bigger. An ant can\u2019t be scaled to the size of an elephant. Because the internal structure is fundamentally different. Instead, companies have to evolve. \n\nBut companies aren\u2019t living, breathing organisms. They\u2019re collections of people \u2014 families, tribes and civilizations. \n\nSo how do you scale a team of two to twenty? The answer starts over 2,000 years ago in Sparta. \n\nThis talk will focus on three distinct military organizations: Spartans, Mongols and Romans. Sparta\u2019s standing army numbered 10,000 whereas Rome\u2019s peaked at half a million. We\u2019ll look at the structure of each military and apply the lessons learned to our development teams and organizations.",
