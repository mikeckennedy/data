  "description": "43% of the world's population live on less than \u20ac1.5 per day.\n\nThe United Nations defines poverty as a \"lack of basic capacity to\nparticipate effectively in society\". While we often think of the poor as\nlacking primarily food and shelter, the UN definition highlights their\nisolation. They have the least access to society's knowledge and\nservices and the most difficulty making themselves and their needs heard\nin our democracies.\n\nWhile smart phones and an exploding ability to collect and process\ninformation are transforming our access to knowledge and the way we\norganize and participate in our societies, those living in poverty have\nlargely been left out. This has to change.\n\nBasic mobile phones present an opportunity to effect this change\n`3 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bXjgx4J0C4#t=20>`__. Only three\ncountries in the world have fewer than 65 mobile phones per 100 people\n`4 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_mobile_phones_in_use>`__.\nThe majority of these phones are not Android or iPhones, but they do\nnevertheless provide a means of communication -- via voice calls, SMSes\n`6 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service>`__, USSD\n`7 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data>`__\nand instant messaging.\n\nBy comparison, 25 countries have less than 5% internet penetration\n`5 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users>`__.\n\nVumi `1 <http://vumi.org/>`__ is an open source text messaging system\ndesigned to reach out to those in poverty on a massive scale via their\nmobile phones. It's written in Python using Twisted.\n\nVumi is already used to:\n\n-  provide Wikipedia access over USSD and SMS in Kenya `8 <http://blog.praekeltfoundation.org/post/65981723628/wikipedia-zero-over-text-with-praekelt-foundation>`__.\n-  register a million voters in Libya\n   `10 <http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/01/01/over-one-million-register-for-constitutional-elections-on-final-sms-registration-day/#axzz2sroHcg00>`__.\n-  deliver health information to mothers in South Africa\n   `9 <http://blog.praekeltfoundation.org/post/65042080515/mama-launches-healthy-family-nutrition-programme>`__.\n-  prevent election violence in Kenya\n   `11 <http://blog.praekeltfoundation.org/post/51210616848/the-texting-will-never-be-done-peace-messages-in-kenya>`__.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\n-  a brief overview of mobile networking and cellphone use in Africa\n-  why we built Vumi\n-  the challenges of operating in unreliable environments\n-  an overview of Vumi's features and architecture\n-  how you can help!\n\nVumi features some cutting edge design choices:\n\n-  horizontally scalable Twisted processes communicating using RabbitMQ.\n-  declarative data models backed by Riak.\n-  sharing common data models between Django and Twisted.\n-  sandboxing hosted Javascript code from Python.\n\nOverview of challenges Vumi addresses:\n\n*Scalability*: Vumi needs to support both small scale applications\n(demos, pilot projects, applications tailored for a particular\ncommunity) and large ones (things that everyone within a country might\nuse). We address this using Twisted workers that exchange messages via\nRabbitMQ and store data in Riak. Having projects share RabbitMQ and Riak\ninstances significantly reduces the overhead for small projects (e.g.\nits not cost effective to launch the recommended minimum of 5 Riak\nservers for a small project).\n\n*Barriers to entry*: Often the people with good ideas don't have access\nto one of many things needed to run a production system themselves, e.g.\ncapital, time, stable infrastructure. We address this by providing a\nhosted Vumi instance that runs sandboxed Javascript applications. All\nthe application author needs is their idea, the ability to write\nJavascript and upload it to our servers. The target audience here is\nAfrican entrepreneurs at incubator spaces like iHub (Nairobi), kLab\n(Kigali), BongoHive (Lusaka) and JoziHub (Johannesburg).\n\n*Unreliable third-party systems*: It's one thing for parts of ones own\nsystem to go down, it's another for crucial third-party systems to go\ndown. Vumi takes an SMTP-like approach to solving this and uses\npersistent queues so that messages can back up in the queue while\nthird-party systems are down and be processed when they become available\nagain. We also feedback information on whether third-party messaging\nsystems have accepted or reject messages to the application that\ninitiated them.\n\nVumi is developed by the Praekelt Foundation\n`2 <http://praekeltfoundation.org/>`__ (and individual contributors!).\n",
