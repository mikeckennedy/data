  "description": "Scraping one web site for information is easy, scraping 10000 different\nsites is hard. Beyond page-specific scraping, how do you build a program\nthan can extract the publication date of (almost) any news article\nonline, no matter the web site? We\u2019ll cover when to use machine learning\nvs. humans or heuristics for data extraction, the different steps of how\nto phrase the problem in terms of machine learning, including feature\nselection on HTML documents, and issues that arise when turning research\ninto production code.Presenter(s): Speaker: Julie Lavoie\n",
