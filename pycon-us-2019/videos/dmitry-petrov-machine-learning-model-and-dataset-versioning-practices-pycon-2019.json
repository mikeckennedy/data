  "description": "Python is a prevalent programming language in machine learning (ML)\ncommunity. A lot of Python engineers and data scientists feel the lack\nof engineering practices like versioning large datasets and ML models,\nand the lack of reproducibility. This lack is particularly acute for\nengineers who just moved to ML space.\n\nWe will discuss the current practices of organizing ML projects using\ntraditional open-source toolset like Git and Git-LFS as well as this\ntoolset limitation. Thereby motivation for developing new ML specific\nversion control systems will be explained.\n\nData Version Control or `DVC.ORG <http://dvc.org>`__ is an `open\nsource <https://github.com/iterative/dvc>`__, command-line tool written\nin Python. We will show how to version datasets with dozens of gigabytes\nof data and version ML models, how to use your favorite cloud storage\n(S3, GCS, or bare metal SSH server) as a data file backend and how to\nembrace the best engineering practices in your ML projects.\n",
