  "description": "Always wanted to publish a package on PyPI, but didn't know where to start? This talk is for you! Starting with nothing, we'll build a package and publish it on PyPI using current best practices. By the end of this talk, you'll be so comfortable packaging projects you won't avoid writing `setup.py` files any more! Maybe you'll even start writing new code just so you can publish it on PyPI!",
