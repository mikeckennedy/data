  "description": "In industrial automation *tried and tested* always beats *latest and\ngreatest*: The machines that make smartphones have a serial port and are\nconfigured with ``.csv`` files. But when your factory automates complex\nnon-linear workflows and is jam-packed with sensors and robots, you are\nquickly faced with software engineering challenges that call for modern\ntools.\n\nPython turns out to be surprisingly versatile in this setting, whether\nfor prototyping a single conveyor belt or taming a building full of\nrobots. This talk explains how to use Python for interfacing with two\ncommon industrial automation devices: a barcode scanner and a\nProgrammable Logic Controller (PLC). After a simple demo, you\u2019ll hear\nabout lessons learned using Python packages that weren\u2019t written with\nrobots in mind, like Celery and pandas, with robots.\n",
