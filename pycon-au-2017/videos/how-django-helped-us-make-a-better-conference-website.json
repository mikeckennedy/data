  "description": "Over the last year, PyCon Australia and linux.conf.au have moved away from a monolithic conference management software package \u2013 developed in-house over the course of several conferences \u2013 to a suite of open source Django apps.\n\nMaking the move to Django allowed linux.conf.au 2017 to pick existing apps that were a best fit for our conference\u2019s needs, and let us focus on building up bespoke apps for the few remaining tasks that hadn\u2019t been solved yet.\n\nWe\u2019ll look at how the move went for linux.conf.au 2017, what went wrong, what went well, and how moving to Django helped us make a conference website that was easier for team members to contribute to, and solved long-standing problems that we couldn\u2019t solve before.\n\nWe\u2019ll also look at the open source projects that we\u2019ve launched and adopted, and show you where you can contribute to making next year\u2019s PyCon AU website even better, or how to use our suite to help run your own conference.",
