  "description": "The neighborhood effects literature represents a wide span of the social\nsciences broadly concerned with the influence of spatial context on\nsocial processes. From the study of segregation dynamics, the\nrelationships between the built environment and health outcomes, to the\nimpact of concentrated poverty on social efficacy, neighborhoods are a\ncentral construct in empirical work. From a dynamic lens, neighborhoods\nexperience changes not only in their socioeconomic composition, but also\nin spatial extent; this latter source of change, however, has been\nlargely neglected in the extant literature. In this paper, we discuss\nthe development of novel, spatially explicit approaches to the study of\nlongitudinal neighborhood dynamics using the scientific Python\necosystem.Presenter(s): Speaker: Serge Rey, University of California,\nRiverside Speaker: Elijah Knaap, University of California Speaker: Su\nHan, University of California Speaker: Levi Wolf, University of Bristol\n",
