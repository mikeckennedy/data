  "summary": "The Chandra X-ray Observatory has been producing significant\nastronomical discoveries since its launch by NASA in July of 1999. The\nChandra operations team uses Python for predictive thermal modeling of\nthe spacecraft to maintain a safe thermal environment. This poster\ndescribes the Xija modeling framework that is used to create, calibrate,\nand compute these thermal models.\n",
