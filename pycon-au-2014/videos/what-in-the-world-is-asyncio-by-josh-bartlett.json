  "description": "The Python 3.4 standard library contains a new module called \"asyncio\"\n(formerly \"tulip\"), which allows you to write single-threaded\nasynchronous code based on PEP 3156. This presentation will begin with\nan outline of what asyncio provides and how to use it, highlighting the\nkinds of use cases that it was designed for. The presentation will then\ngo through a number of example use cases and within the context of these\nuse cases, will compare asyncio with Twisted, one of the existing\nlibraries for asynchronous programming. Finally, the presentation will\ntouch on the question of interoperability between asyncio and libraries\nlike Twisted, Pyramid and gevent.\n",
