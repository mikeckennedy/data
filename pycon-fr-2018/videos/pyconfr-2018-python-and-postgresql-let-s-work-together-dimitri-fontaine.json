  "description": "Python is often used to maintain application backends. When the backend\nshould implement user oriented workflows, it may rely on a RDBMS\ncomponent to take care of the system's integrity.\n\nPostgreSQL is the world's most advanced open source relational database,\nand is very good at taking care of your system's integrity. PostgreSQL\nalso comes with a ton of data processing power, and in many cases a\nsimple enough SQL statement may replace hundreds of lines of code\nwritten in Python.\n\nIn this talk, we learn advanced SQL techniques and how to reason about\nwhich part of the backend code should be done in the database, and which\nparf of the backend code is so easier to write as a SQL query.\n\nAll levels.\n",
