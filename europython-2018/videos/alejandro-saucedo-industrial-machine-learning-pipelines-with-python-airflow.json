  "description": "Industrial Machine Learning\n===========================\n\nThis talk will provide key insights on the learnings I have obtained\nthroughout my career building & deploying machine learning systems in\ncritical environments across several sectors. I will provide a deep dive\non how to build scalable and distributed machine learning data pipelines\nusing Airflow with a Celery backend. I will also compare Airflow with\nother technologies available out there and how it differentiates, such\nas Luigi, Chronos, Pinball, etc. If you attend the talk, you will obtain\nan understanding on the solid fundamentals of Airflow, together with its\ncaveats and walk-arounds for more complex use-cases. As we proceed with\nthe examples, I will cover the challenges that you will run into when\nscaling Machine Learning systems, and how Airflow can be used to address\nthese using a manager-worker-queue architecture for distributed\nprocessing with Celery. By the end of this talk you will have the\nknowledge required to build your own industry-ready machine learning\npipelines to process data at scale, and I will provide further reading\nresources so people are able to implement the knowledge obtained almost\nright away.\n",
