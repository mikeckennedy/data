  "description": "In this tutorial, Eloy Zu\u00f1iga, Jr. and Joel Watts will work through the\nprocess of building an event-driven application using\n```asyncio`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`__ and web\ntechnologies. By the end, we hope you'll be able to answer the following\nquestions:\n\n-  Why should I care about async programming at all?\n-  What is ``asyncio`` and how is it used?\n-  How do I use this stuff to solve real-world problems?\n\nWe'll assume some familiarity with Python, but no prior experience with\nasync programming is required. Please come with Python 3.4+ installed.\n\nAll the codez can be found in these 2 repos\n\n-  https://github.com/eloyz/aioui\n-  https://github.com/jpwatts/aioserver\n\n",
