  "description": "As the world's data grows, so does its aptitude for AI.\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the context of business, however, translating black-box-magic into\nsomething more accessible for business-users to engage with is tricky.\nWhile this speaks to a larger problem of upskilling and making education\nmore accessible, one method of translation is through story telling.\n\nI learn best when an **idea is relatable, simple, and colourful**. This\ntalk is going to look at how to convey complex ideas simply. I'm going\nto be covering two sections:\n\n1. That's So Random (Forests)!\n2. You Gotta (Neural) Network to Get Work\n\nI'll run through the high level concepts and methodologies, and then\nshow the work/code that was done to create a random forest, and a neural\nnetwork. Note: this will cover how I built the RF, and NN using Python\nvia Jupyter Notebook.\n\nThis session is for anyone who uses/wants to use ML to solve problems\nbut struggles with translating the black-box-magic. It's going to be an\nengaging, and slightly animated, talk with the intention of reinforcing\nconcepts and showcasing different ways of explaining them.\n",
