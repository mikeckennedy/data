We're aware of that.\nHowever, it's not always clear how we can follow abstract ideals like\nelegance, simplicity, and extensibility to improve our APIs. That's why\nin this talk we'll discuss good and bad APIs with real-world examples.\nFor each thing learned, we'll come up with a checklist to help us with\npractical advice for writing good APIs.\n",
