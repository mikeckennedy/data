We\u2019ll go over\ndifferent transcription options available today and provide a demo of\nconverting audio data into text. We\u2019ll review ways of storing and\nsearching text data at scale using open source tools and Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) techniques. Going further we\u2019ll explore\ndifferent techniques for building machine learning models on the\ntranscribed text data. You\u2019ll leave this session with a firm\nunderstanding of how to take audio data and convert it into actionable\ninsights.\n",
