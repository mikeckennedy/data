  "description": "In the last year we have been working on a full featured, Python\npowered, RESTful Web API. We learned quite a few things on REST best\npatterns, and we got a chance to put Python\u2019s renowned web capabilities\nunder review, even releasing a couple Open Source projects in the\nprocess. In my talk I will share what we learned. We will consider\n\u2018pure\u2019 REST API design and its many hurdles. We will look at what Python\nas to offer in this field and finally, we will dig further down by\nlooking at some of the code we developed. Some of the\ntechnologies/stacks I\u2019ll cover are (in no particular order): Flask,\nPyMongo, MongoDB, REST, JSON, XML, Heroku. Did you know? Like it or not,\nthere is going to be a REST API in your future.\n",
