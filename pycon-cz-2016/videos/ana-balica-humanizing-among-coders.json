  "description": "What makes a good developer? Certainly technical expertise,\ninsightfulness, creativity, thoughtfulness. What about daily social\ninteractions with other developers inside the company and community?\nThose are never easy. Even though we all try to be nice to each\nother, sometimes unintentionally we can be a bit off. I'd like to\nshare with you some stories that helped me rationalize some of my own\ncommunication and human interaction mistakes and how I'm trying to\ncorrect them.",
