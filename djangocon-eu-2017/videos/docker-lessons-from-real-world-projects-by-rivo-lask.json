  "description": "Docker has received a lot of hype since it became available a few years ago. While lots of developers have played around with it, going through tutorials and small demo projects, we often lack practical experience of bigger, real-world projects. Docker can be quite useful in these contexts due to provided service isolation and build reproducability, among other benefits.\nThis talk begins by exploring reasons for using Docker in the first place. I will then demonstrate how to convert projects with multiple dependent services and build steps to use Docker and how it changes the usual Django development workflow. Next I will go through some of the subtleties and pain points we've encountered when doing so. Some general advice for moving towards production will be offered as well.",
