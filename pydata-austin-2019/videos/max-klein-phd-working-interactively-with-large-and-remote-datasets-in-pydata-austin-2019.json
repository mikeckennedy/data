  "description": "Though Jupyter notebooks are a useful tool for working with datasets of all shapes and sizes, until now a user has had to write their own custom code within the notebook in order to marshal and load large or remote datasets. Recently, significant progress has been made towards adding tools to the JupyterLab UI that will enable working interactively with such datasets.",
