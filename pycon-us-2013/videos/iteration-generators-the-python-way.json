  "summary": "Did you know that \"for a, (b, c) in s:\" is a valid Python line? From the\nelegant for statement through list/set/dict comprehensions and generator\nfunctions, this talk shows how the Iterator pattern is so deeply\nembedded in the syntax of Python, and so widely supported by its\nlibraries, that some of its most powerful applications can be overlooked\nby programmers coming from other languages.\n",
