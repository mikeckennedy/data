  "summary": "Presenter: Fernando Perez\n\nIPython began its life as a personal \"afternoon hack\", but almost 12\nyears later it has become a large and complex project, where we try to\nthink in a comprehensive and coherent way about many related problems in\nscientific computing. Despite all the moving parts in IPython, there are\nactually very few key ideas that drive our vision, and I will discuss\nhow we seek to turn this vision into concrete technical constructs. We\nfocus on making the computer a tool for insight and communication, and\nwe will see how every piece of the IPython architecture is driven by\nthese ideas.\n\nI will also look at IPython in the context of the broader SciPy\necosystem: both how the project's user and developer community has\nevolved over time, and how it maintains an ongoing dialogue with the\nrest of this ecosystem. We have learned some important lessons along the\nway that I hope to share, as well as considering the challenges that lie\nahead.\n",
