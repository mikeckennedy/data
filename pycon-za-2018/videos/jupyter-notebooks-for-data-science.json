  "description": "This talk is intended for beginner and intermediate data scientists/\nanalysts/ engineers, although I hope that even experienced data\nscientists can gain something from the talk.\n\nThe talk will focus on using Jupyter notebooks in data science\napplications. I will discuss the basics of how to get it up and running\nand the common features like using markup and code in the same notebook,\nI will highlight the advantages of working in a notebook rather than a\ntraditional IDE. I will also discuss other features like using code\nsnippets, autocomplete, linting and creating a table of contents.\nInserting images and videos into a notebook along side your code can be\na handy way of learning something new. I will end the talk with a look\ninto jupyterlab.\n\nAttendees of this course will gain an understanding and appreciation of\nthe quick prototyping that is afforded to you when using Jupyter\nnotebooks in your data science pipeline. Especially when it comes to\nexploratory data analysis. I want to be able to showcase all the common\nfeatures of Jupyter notebooks but also some less known ones, so that\nthere everyone attending the talk will learn something.\n",
