  "description": "Can you remember the difference between two hex color values? Me neither! Tracking screenshots of changes to visual projects in version control (Git) makes review of past changes easier, speeds acclimation to a new web project, and increases our understanding of tools used for automated testing. Join me for a review of integrated screenshot methods currently in use (ie. Python\u2019s Pyppeteer) and explore how you can customize a system to integrate screenshots into your version control, lower your cognitive load, and support new contributors.",
