  "description": "This talk is designed to give you all the tools you will need to go home and start using satellite imagery to make an impact on the world. The talk will cover finding, processing, evaluating and visualizing open satellite data using open source tools written in python.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nEarth imaging satellites, just like our computers, are shrinking and becoming more ubiquitous than ever before. It is now possible to obtain open satellite data on a daily if not weekly basis and for this data to be put to work; helping us better understand our planet and quickly respond to disaster situations.\n\nIn this talk we will work through a jupyter notebook that covers the satellite data ecosystem and the python tools that can be used to sift through and analyze that data. Topics include python tools for using Open Street Maps data, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), and OpenCV and NumPy for image processing. This talk is intended for novice and intermediate python developers who are interested in using data science and satellite imagery for social good and fundamental scientific research.\n\n**Bio**\n\nKatherine Scott is the image analytics team lead at Planet Labs. Katherine holds a masters degree in computer science from Columbia University and dual engineering degrees from the University of Michigan. Prior to working at Planet Katherine was a co-founder at Tempo Automation and Sight Machine.",
