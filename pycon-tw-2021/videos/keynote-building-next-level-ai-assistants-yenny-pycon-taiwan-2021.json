    "description": "Day 1, 16:15 ~ 17:15\n\nAI assistants are the new faces of tech. We can now control our lights, play music, make an account transfer, and buy insurance from a chat or voice interface. Conversational AI opens up tech further to serve the people who were once left behind.\n\nBuilding AI assistants from scratch is very challenging. But now, we have much better tooling and infrastructure that make use of cutting-edge NLP research. In this talk, we will explore the current state of the technology: the level of experience we can provide for the end-user, the ease of building AI assistants from the dev perspective, and the maturity across different languages. We\u2019ll also pull up our sleeves and develop an AI assistant together!\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\nHackMD: https://hackmd.io/@pycontw/2021/%2F%40pycontw%2FH1HD2WYGY\n\nSpeaker: Yenny Cheung\n\nOriginally from Hong Kong, Yenny is an engineering leader at Rasa.
