  "description": "A normal Science teacher and his journey into Python and the impact it has had on his STEM teaching\n\nSix years ago I was happily teaching Science and a little bit of IT at\nschool. I had done some basic programming a long time ago but this was\nmostly from magazines as a kid. Jump forward six years and I am now\nleading on Computer Science at Key Stage 3 and engaging learners in\nChemistry and Physics with physical computing, digital making and\nprogramming.\n\nThis has been an exciting journey and has transformed the way I teach\nScience and developed the skills to teach Key Stage 3 Computer Science.\nAt the heart of this has been Python and I would love to share that\njourney with you and how I brought Python into school in more than just\nComputer Science lessons.",
