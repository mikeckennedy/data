  "description": "Flask is a great web mirco-framework, that is best utilised with\nevent-loop concurrency. Sadly with Flask the event-loop framework can\u2019t\nbe asyncio, although some extensions (Flask-Aiohttp) have tried. Quart\nis the solution as it shares the Flask API and is based on asyncio. In\naddition Quart goes beyond Flask adding HTTP/2 and websockets.\n\nThis talk will outline why event-loop concurrency is a good choice for\nweb servers, why asyncio is a good choice and then give an overview of\nQuart, demonstrating features that go beyond the Flask framework.\n",
