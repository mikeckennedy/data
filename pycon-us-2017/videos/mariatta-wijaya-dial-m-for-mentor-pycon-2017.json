  "description": "One of the nicest things about Python community is the availability of\nmentors willing to help you. Various mentors have helped me navigate the\nopen source community and help advanced my skills. I realized finding a\nmentor is not as easy as it seems, and it takes a lot of courage to\nreach out in the first place. And then, there is impostor syndrome,\nwhere one may feel like they don\u2019t deserve the help. In this talk, I\nwill provide advice about working with a mentor. Asking for help is not\na failure.\n",
