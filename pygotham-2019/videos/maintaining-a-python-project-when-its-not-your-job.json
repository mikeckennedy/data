  "description": "PyPI is a gold mine of great packages but those packages have to be written\nfirst.  More often than not, projects that millions of people depend on are\nwritten and maintained by only one person.  If you\u2019re unlucky, that person\nis you!\n\nSo how do you square delivering a *high quality* Python package you can be\nproud of and having only limited time at your disposal?  The answer is not\n\u201ctry harder,\u201d the answer is to **do less**.\n\nThis talk will help you get there by talking about how you can make your\nlife easier, remove causes of friction with your contributors, and empower\nsaid contributors to take over tasks that you can\u2019t make time for anymore.",
