  "abstract": "NLP is an exciting way to interpret the textual data especially when we\nknow that computer neither speak nor understand any kind of human\nlanguage. So, how do we represent each word of a language in such a\nunique numerical pattern and process it in quickest way possible. Answer\nis FastText library.\n\n*Tags:* Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning & Artificial\nIntelligence, Data Science, NLP, Machine Learning\n\nScheduled on `friday 10:30 </schedule/#fri-10:30-cubus>`__ in room cubus\n",

  "description": "FastText has been open-sourced by Facebook in 2016 and with its release,\nit became the fastest and most accurate library in Python for text\nclassification and word representation. It is to be seen as a substitute\nfor gensim package's word2vec. It includes the implementation of two\nextremely important methodologies in NLP i.e Continuous Bag of Words and\nSkip-gram model. Fasttext performs exceptionally well with supervised as\nwell as unsupervised learning.\n\nThe tutorial will be divided in following four segments :\n",
