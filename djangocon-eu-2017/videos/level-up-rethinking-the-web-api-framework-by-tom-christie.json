  "description": "Think there's nothing left to explore in how we design Web API frameworks? Think again.\n\nThe author of Django REST framework walks through how we might approach designing a new Python-based API framework from scratch, and looks at how we can start building smarter, more productive API tooling as a result.\n\nYou should come away from this talk with a better appreciation of:\n\n* How best to provide API client libraries and API documentation to your users.\n* How to build APIs that support both realtime and request/response interfaces.\n* How to build APIs that are web-browsable.\n* Why you might want to consider taking a schema-first approach to your API design.",
