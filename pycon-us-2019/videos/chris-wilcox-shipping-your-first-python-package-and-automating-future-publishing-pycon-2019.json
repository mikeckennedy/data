  "description": "One of the best things about Python is the vast ecosystem of packages\navailable on the Python Package Index. Shipping your first Python\npackage can be intimidating. This talk aims to remove the mystery of\nPython packaging and enable you to share your code with other\nPythonistas. We will also discuss more recent additions to packaging\nthat can be used even if you are an experienced package maintainer. The\nlatter portion of the talk will be dedicated to talking about how you\ncan automate releasing via CI to make future updates a breeze.\n",
