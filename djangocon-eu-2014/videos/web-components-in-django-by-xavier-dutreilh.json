  "description": "Django is by far one of the best frameworks to build web applications.\nHowever, it suffers from the lack of efficient tools to create good\nfront- ends. So, we often end up writing a lot of ad-hoc codes without\nany methodology, and using a ton of ready-to-use libraries. Alas, this\nway of designing front-ends is a terrible idea and we need to engineer\nthese things properly.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce you to the core concepts of web\ncomponents and their suitability in modern web applications. Then, I\nwill show you the methodology to build them and the tools that you need\nto use. Finally, I will describe you the process to integrate them into\na Django project.\n",
