  "description": "Recently we've seen the rise of new technologies like Julia, those have\nthe ability to build a new ecosystem on a clean slate and thus be better\nthan Python in some aspects. What would it take to be as good as those\ntechnologies on those aspects without loosing all the things we love\nabout Python? This talk will describe my perfect future where Python\nkeeps getting better, gets to keep it's great set of libraries, where\nPyPy fits in that future and why C extensions are a big road block.\n",
