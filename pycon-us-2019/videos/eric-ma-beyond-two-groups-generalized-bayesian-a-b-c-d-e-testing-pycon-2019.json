  "description": "Bayesian A/B testing has gained much popularity over the years. It\nseems, however, that the examples stop at two groups. This begs the\nquestions: should we not be able to do more than simple two-group,\ncase/control comparisons? Is there a special procedure that's necessary,\nor is there a natural extension of commonly-used Bayesian methods?\n\nIn this talk, I will use life-like, simulated examples, inspired from\nwork and from meeting others at conferences, to show how to generalize\nA/B testing beyond the rigid assumptions commonly highlighted.\nSpecifically, I will show two examples, one involving Bayesian\nestimation on click data on a website, and another on 4-parameter\ndose-response curves.\n\nThere will be plenty of code from the modern PyData stack, involving the\nuse of PyMC3, pandas, holoviews, and more.\n",
