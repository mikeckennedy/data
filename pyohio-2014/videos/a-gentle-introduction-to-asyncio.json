  "summary": "Asyncio is the new standard library module for doing asynchronous IO and\nconcurrency in Python 3.4. In this talk, I'll discuss some earlier\nstrategies for writing such code in Python. I'll cover some of the\ndecisions that went into it's design. Then I'll walk through a tuturial\non asyncio itself. Finally, I'll take some well known example code for\nGevent and Twisted, and rewrite it in asyncio.\n",
