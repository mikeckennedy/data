  "description": "Vincent D. Warmerdam - PySpark and Warcraft Data\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nIn this talk I will describe how to use Apache Spark (PySpark) with\nsome data from the World of Warcraft API from an iPython notebook.\nSpark is interesting because it speeds up iterative processes on your\nhadoop cluster as well as your local machine.\n\nI will give basic benchmarks (comparing it to numpy/pandas/scikit),\nexplain the architecture/performance behind the technology and will\ngive a live demo on how I used Spark to analyse an interesting\ndataset. I'll explain why you might want to use Spark and I'll also go\nin and explain when you don't want to use it.\n\nThe dataset I will be using is a 22Gb json blob containing auction\nhouse data from all world of warcraft servers over a period of time.\nThe goal of the analysis will be to determine when and if basic\neconomics still applies in a massively online game.\n\nI will assume that the everyone knows what the ipython notebook is and\nI will assume a basic knowledge of numpy/pandas but nothing fancy. The\ndataset has been chosen such that people who are less interested in\nSpark can still enjoy the analysis part of the talk. If you know very\nlittle about data science but if you love video games then you should\nlike this talk.",
