  "description": "Take care of the most important thing, your psychophysical well-being,\nand be efficient about it. You don\u2019t need to be hungry (well, just a\nlittle bit), do lots of exercise (well, just a little bit) and spend a\nlot of time and money (well, just a little bit\u2026 uhm, there seems to be a\npattern :-) ). You just need to take care of your body using the same\nthing that lets you program computers: your mind. No, the human body is\nnot \u201ca machine\u201d, as it\u2019s often said: it\u2019s much more complex than that.\nNonetheless, knowledge of a few facts, some guiding principles, and some\ntech tools (we\u2019re geeks after all, aren\u2019t we? :-) ) can definitely\nimprove your life. Warning: this speaker is not a doctor, and this talk\nis not medical advice. Get the advice of a qualified doctor/physician\nbefore changing your diet and/or your physical regimen. Neither this\nspeaker nor the conference organization will be liable for any injuries\nor illnesses you may incur by however applying the concepts discussed in\nthis talk.\n",
