Have you tried doing the official Django tutorial and had no idea what was going on?\r\n\r\nThis talk is a story about how I learnt Django and Python coming from a non-tech industry, during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will cover tips for beginners on how best to get started with Django and Python.\r\n\r\nI will be sharing about mistakes that I made, resources that I found useful, and how I created connections both online and offline.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 16:00:00 2020 at Python 2",
