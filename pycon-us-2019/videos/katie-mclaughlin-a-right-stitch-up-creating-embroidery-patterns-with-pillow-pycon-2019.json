  "description": "Embroidery is a technology that dates back centuries and is still\npopular in the present day among craftspeople around the world.\nCross-stitch refers to the creation of crosses in a grid that combines\nto build up an image, based on a 'chart' or pattern of the intended\ndesign.\n\nEven though entire pieces could be created based on completely manual\nprocesses, much of the technology behind automating chart creation is\nlocked behind paid software.\n\nDuring this presentation, we will discuss how we can leverage the Python\nImaging Library (PIL, now Pillow) in order to take source images and\nturn them into cross-stitch charts.\n\nThe resulting art piece from the talk, the PyCon US 2019 logo, will be\nauctioned off at the PyLadies Charity Auction. Tickets to the Charity\nAuction available separately, see website for details.\n",
