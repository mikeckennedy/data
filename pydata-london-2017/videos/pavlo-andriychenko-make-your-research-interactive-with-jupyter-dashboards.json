  "description": "Filmed at PyData London 2017 \n\nDescription\nI will show the tools and processes for building interactive web apps using the Jupyter stack. Simple, easy, beautiful.\n\nAbstract\nJupyter is great for tinkering and research. But what if you are not the only consumer of that notebook? What if other consumers want to slice and visualise your data differently? I will show how to turn fresh ideas or existing Jupyter notebooks into beautiful web apps without the need to worry about the web server, HTTP and content deployment.",
