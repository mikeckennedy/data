  "description": "Processing thousands of satellite images to understand air quality in the UK - it's efficient and easy with XArray\n\n\"I wish there was a way to easily manipulate this huge multi-dimensional\narray in Python...\", I thought, as I stared at a huge chunk of satellite\ndata on my laptop. The data was from a satellite measuring air quality -\nand I wanted to slice and dice the data in some supposedly simple ways.\nUsing pure numpy - the go-to library when the words 'multi-dimensional',\n'array' and 'python' are mentioned in the same sentence - was just such\na pain. What I wished for was something like pandas - with datetime\nindexes, fancy ways of selecting subsets, group-by operations and so on\n- but something that would work with my huge multi-dimensional array.\n\nThe solution: XArray - a wonderful library which provides the power of\npandas for multi-dimensional data. In this talk I will introduce the\nXArray library by showing how just a few lines of code can answer\nquestions about my data that would take a lot of complex code to answer\nwith pure numpy - questions like 'What is the average air quality in\nMarch?', 'What is the time series of air quality in Southampton?' and\n'What is the seasonal average air quality for each census output area?'.\n\nAfter demonstrating how these questions can be answered easily with\nXArray, I will introduce the fundamental XArray data types, and show how\nindexes can be added to raw arrays to fully utilise the power of XArray.\nI will discuss how to get data in and out of XArray, and how XArray can\nuse dask for high- performance data processing on multiple cores, or\ndistributed across multiple machines. Finally I will leave you with a\ntaster of some of the advanced features of XArray - including seamless\naccess to data via the internet using OpenDAP, complex apply functions,\nand XArray extension libraries.",
