  "description": "During this talk, you'll learn the answer to the questions: why, how, what kind of, and where you should think of using type hints when writing Python. And yes, we'll include all sort of Python species, not just the fancy latest 3.5+ ones. Furthermore, you'll learn how to re-use type hints for much more than just type checking.\n\nVideo Copyright belongs to the speaker.",
