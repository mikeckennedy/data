  "description": "Few people attend conferences just to attend the associated sprints.\nHowever, I want to tell you a story about how sprints offer a unique space\nfor certain kinds of ideas and collaboration that are otherwise difficult or\nimpossible to cultivate.\n\nI will begin at the end, by describing the `pandas-vet` plugin for the\n`flake8` linter. I will briefly summarize some elements underlying the\n`flake8` plugin (`pandas` best practices, traversing the AST, and\nentrypoints) as well as elements of a good open-source project (tests, CI,\npip-installable, contributor guidelines, and a code of conduct).\n\nNext, through Slack messages and GitHub commits, I will tell the story of\nhow the sprinting environment helped the project go from vague idea to\nimplementing all of those elements in just one day.\n\nThroughout the talk, I'll offer some of the lessons we should all learn\nabout what makes sprints unique, what makes them successful, and how this\nproject could only have been built in a sprint environment.",
