  "description": "There are many ways you can test your software: unit testing, manual\ntesting, end-to-end testing, and so forth. Take a step back and you'll\ndiscover even more form of testing, many of them very different in their\ngoals: A/B testing, say, where you see which of two versions of your\nwebsite results in more signups or ad clicks.\n\nHow do these forms of testing differ, how do they relate to each other?\nHow do you choose which kind of testing to pursue, given limited time\nand resources? How do you deal with strongly held yet opposite views\narguing either that a particular kind of testing is essential or that\nit's a waste time?\n\nThis talk will provide you with a model, a way to organize all forms of\ntesting and understand what exactly they provide, and why. Once you\nunderstand the model you will be able to choose the right form of\ntesting for *your* situation and goals.\n",
