  "description": "In the past it was simpler and easier to think of building websites\nexclusively for desktop monitors capable of showing 1024x768 pixels,\nsitting on the desk of a non-impaired, English-speaking person. But\ntoday we need to embrace a much broader range of users. And one part of\nthis is designing sites for the visually impaired.\n\nThere are automatic checkers that you can use to assess your site\u2019s\naccessibility. It will tell you that all your images need an alt tag,\nand that the H2 should come after the H1. This is a good start, but even\nif you dot all your i\u2019s and cross all your t\u2019s and get 100% pass, your\nsite may be an unnavigable mess in practice.\n\nIn this talk we will look at and *listen to* real world examples of\nwebsites that either pass or fail the accessibility test. We will hear\nanecdotes from actual visually impaired users and discover how they\nnavigate the web. And we will see that even though frameworks like\nDjango can set us up for success, it\u2019s up to us as developers to follow\nthrough.\n",
