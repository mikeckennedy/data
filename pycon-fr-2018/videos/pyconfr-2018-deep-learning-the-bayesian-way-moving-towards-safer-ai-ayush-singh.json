  "description": "With the advancements in the domain of Deep learning, it has found\napplication in various real-life problems such as self-driving cars and\nhealthcare diagnosis. But with great powers comes greater\nresponsibility, so the question arises, \u201cIs our AI safe ?\u201d\n\nThe critical part of any machine learning system is understanding what\nit does not know. Unfortunately, today\u2019s deep learning algorithms are\nusually unable to understand their uncertainty.\n\nThis talk will provide an introduction to the resurging filed of\nBayesian Deep Learning. I would be discussing various theoretical\naspects and the current state-of-the-art in this domain. I would be\ntaking you through the code for constructing Bayesian deep nets and\nvisualizing their uncertainty in their results using libraries like\nPyMC3, Pytorch.\n\nThe prerequisites for this talk familiarity with basic probability,\nIntermediary python, and passion to learn something new :)\n",
