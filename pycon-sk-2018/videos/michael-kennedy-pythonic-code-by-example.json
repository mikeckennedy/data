  "description": "We often hear the term Pythonic thrown around, but what exactly does it\nmean? This talk will take you on a tour of some of the more important\npythonic concepts. You will see many examples of perfectly functional\nPython code that is quite non-pythonic. We will evolve that code into\nmore an idiomatic form that fits better with the Python language and its\nusers.\n",
