  "description": "Do you understand how Python works under the hood? Can you explain the following?\n\nWhy does `a is b` evaluate to `True` when both variables have a value of 201? Why does the statement evaluate to` False` if they both have a value of 498?\nWhen will Python still hold a reference to an object that has been deleted?\nHow does Python collect garbage and is it any different from other languages like Ruby?\n\nLearn the answers to these questions and better understand concepts like interning, reference counting, reference cycles, and generational garbage collection in this talk.",
