  "description": "What good is a code style if it's not internally consistent? What good\nis a linter when it slows you down? What if you could out-source your\nworries about code formatting, adopt a consistent style, and make your\nteam faster all at the same time?\n\nCome hear about Black: a new code style and a tool that allows you to\nformat your Python code automatically. In the talk you'll learn not only\nhow the style looks like but why it is the way it is. I will do my best\nto convince you not only that it's good but that it's *good enough*.\nYou'll see how you can integrate it with your current workflow and how\nit speeds up your life while making your code prettier on average.\n\nLose your attachments, delegate the boring job of moving tokens around\nto satisfy the linter, and save time for more important matters.\nGuaranteed to increase the life expectancy of space bars and Enter keys\non your new MacBook's keyboard.\n",
