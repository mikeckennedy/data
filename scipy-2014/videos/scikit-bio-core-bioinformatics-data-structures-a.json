  "description": "Python is widely used in computational biology, with many high profile\nbioinformatics software projects, such as\n`Galaxy <http://galaxyproject.org/>`__,\n`Khmer <http://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ and\n`QIIME <http://www.qiime.org>`__, being largely or entirely written in\nPython. We present `scikit-bio <http://www.scikit-bio.org>`__, a new\nlibrary based on the standard Python scientific computing stack (e.g.,\nnumpy, scipy, and matplotlib) implementing core bioinformatics data\nstructures, algorithms, parsers, and formatters. scikit-bio is the first\nbioinformatics-centric `scikit <https://scikits.appspot.com/>`__, and\narises from over ten years of development efforts on\n`PyCogent <http://www.pycogent.org>`__ and\n`QIIME <http://www.qiime.org>`__, representing an effort to update the\nfunctionality provided by these extensively used tools, and to make that\nfunctionality more accessible. scikit-bio is intended to be useful both\nas a resource for students, who can learn topics such as heuristic-based\nsequence database searching or iterative progressive multiple sequence\nalignment from the source code and accompanying documentation, and as a\npowerful library for 'real-world' bioinformatics developers. To achieve\nthese goals, scikit-bio development is centered around test-driven,\npeer-reviewed software development; C/Cython integration for\ncomputationally expensive algorithms; extensive API documentation and\ndoc-testing based on the `numpy docstring\nstandards <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`__;\nuser documentation and `theoretical discussion of topics in IPython\nNotebooks <http://caporasolab.us/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/>`__;\nadherence to PEP8; and continuous integration testing. scikit-bio is\navailable free of charge under the BSD license.\n",
