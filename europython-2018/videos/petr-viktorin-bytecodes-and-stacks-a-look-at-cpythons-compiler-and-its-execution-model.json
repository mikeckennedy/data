  "description": "So, you wrote some Python code. What needs to happen before it starts\nrunning? And once it\u2019s running, how does Python keep track of what it\u2019s\ndoing?\n\nI\u2019ll talk about CPython\u2019s tokenization, parsing, bytecode and its\nserialization and cache, the stack-based virtual machine, line number\ntables, and code, frame and function objects.\n\nDon\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve never heard of these concepts. While even experts\nshould learn something new, the talk is aimed at anyone who\u2019s worked on\na Python project or two.\n",
