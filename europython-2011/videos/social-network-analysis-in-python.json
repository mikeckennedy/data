  "description": "Network Analysis has gained a huge recognition since the widespread\nadoption of on-line social networking systems. It is a\ncross-disciplinary subject with important contributions from researchers\nof different areas such as physics, sociology, maths and computer\nscience.\n\nHowever, Network Analysis is also a useful tool for the working\nprogrammer. The basic techniques which will be introduced in this talk\ncan be used, for example, both to i) test the robustness and resilience\nto damage of a technological network and ii) understand the structure of\na social network, which can in turn lead to insight on trends and\npreferences gathering information from modern on-line social networking\nsystems.\n\nAlong with the concepts, working Python code is presented, both using\nexisting network analysis Python tools and numeric packages. The focus\nis mainly placed on code, which will be shown and discussed together\nwith the formal theory.\n\nBasic maths skills and basic knowledge of the Python programming\nlanguage are the only suggested prerequisites.\n",
