  "description": "Django-CMS-Cascade, is a feature rich plugin system for Django-CMS, which is easy to extend and without adding new database models.\nIn this presentation I will show how to integrate this plugin system into a running Django-CMS installation and show how one can quickly create impressive websites.Then I will show how one can create his own plugins with a few lines of Python and HTML code. Furthermore I will show how to extend all plugins with common functionality, such as shared attributes, inline styles and classes, private rendering templates and content versioning.",
