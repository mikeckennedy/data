  "description": "The admin interface that comes built-in with Django is one of the\nmost-loved (and oft-abused) features. However, early converts are often\ndisappointed to find that the admin doesn't seem to be scaling as their\ndatabase grows in size, forcing them (so they think) to switch to a\ncustom interface much sooner than they would prefer.\n\nHowever, many common performance issues can be fixed with a few small\nconfiguration changes that are much easier than a rewrite!\n\nIn this talk, we'll use an example project to demonstrate the most\ncommon performance pitfalls encountered when using the Django admin, and\nfix them - live! We'll use django-debug-toolbar, a powerful debugging\ninterface that everyone who uses Django should be familiar with, to\nidentify our issues and confirm that they are fixed.\n",
