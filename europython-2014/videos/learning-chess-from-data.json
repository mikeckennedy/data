Is chess games\ndescriptions expose good enough data to gain understanding of chess\nrules - legal piece moves, castling, check versus checkmate, etc. Which\nfeatures are important in describing a chess game and which features are\nnot. What is a good representation of a chess game for this uses. What\nis the minimal sample size which is required in order to learn this in a\ngood enough manner and where this learning can go wrong.\n\n**Ne3 => E=mc2**\n\nLooking at the bigger picture - Can we understand big systems based on\nempirical samples. Can we reverse engineer physics and discover how\nphysical system work based on no external knowledge beside empirical\nsamples.\n",
