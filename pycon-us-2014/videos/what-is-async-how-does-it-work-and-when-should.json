  "summary": "Python's asynchronous frameworks, like Tulip, Tornado, and Twisted, are\nincreasingly important for writing high-performance web applications.\nEven if you're an experienced web programmer, you may lack a rigorous\nunderstanding of how these frameworks work and when to use them. Let's\nsee how Tulip's event loop works, and learn how to efficiently handle\nvery large numbers of concurrent connections.\n",
