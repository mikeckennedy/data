  "description": "PyConAU 2010 KeyNote\n\nPresented by Mark Pesce\n\nAlthough Mark Pesce does know Python, he doesn't consider himself any\nsort of expert so he won't be talking about Python, except to whinge\nthat his friends pick on him for choosing a language which uses\nwhitespace as syntax. Try as he might, he can't get his friends to see\nthe logic of this - even though they always pretty-print their own code,\nin whatever language they write. Go figure. So, Mark will not be talking\nabout that. What will Mark be talking about? Well, um, err... (sound of\nshuffling papers) ...oh, yeah, here it is: 'Mark Pesce will be talking\nabout stuff. And things. And how great it all is. No, really. You'll\nsee. Promise.' ? Mark is best-known as the co-inventor of VRML, and as\npanelist/judge on ABC's \"The New Inventors\". The author of five books\nand numerous articles, he has a monthly column in NETT magazine, is a\nfrequent contributor to ABC Unleashed, and is a sought-after commentator\non both radio and television. Since 2006, Pesce has held an Honorary\nAppointment in the Digital Cultures Program at the University of Sydney.\n\n[NOTES: ~10 secs lost audio at start]\n",
