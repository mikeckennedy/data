  "description": "As members of the Python community, we all believe that computers have the\n_potential_ to do great things.\n\nBut are the things we're doing with computers, overall, _actually_ great?\nWhat is the _purpose_ of computers?  Why do we build software for them?  How\ncan we do it better?  And: should we be making anything other than video\ngames?\n\nIn this talk, Glyph will answer those questions, and more; some of his\nproposed answers might surprise you.  He will present extensive digressions\non the history of the craft and industry of software development, the impact\nthat recent events have had on the course of that history, and he will\ncontemplate new directions which might lead toward a brighter tomorrow.\nAlong the way, he will consider what lessons we might learn from the\nprogression of other, similar fields, such as medieval church architecture\nand nuclear power generation.",
