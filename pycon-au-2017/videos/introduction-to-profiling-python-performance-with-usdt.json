  "description": "As of Python3.6 SystemTap/DTrace probes\u00a0have been added to the python interpreter which mean that we have the ability to inspect GC pause, function entrance and exit and a few other internal procedures of the process. Using these markers, we can diagnose the most difficult of runtime issues with unprecedented access to the running state of the application, in particular allowing SysAdmins/DevOps/Production Engineers to better understand why a particular application is misbehaving.\n\nIn this talk, I'll explain what these probes are, how it works and provide examples as to how you can leverage the SystemTap and BPF interface to debug some of the more complex systems. I will cover when these tools are the right thing to use and give insight to when you should be using something different and more appropriate.",
