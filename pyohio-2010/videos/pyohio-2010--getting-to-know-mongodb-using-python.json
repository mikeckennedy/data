  "description": "Getting to know MongoDB using Python and IronPython\n\nPresented by Sam Corder\n\nIs your RDBMS not coping with the load anymore and can't be scaled out\nany further? Are you designing the next big thing and know your RDBMS\nwon't be able to handle it? Are you tired of shoe-horning a data model\ninto where it doesn't belong? Are you just curious what this thing\ncalled MongoDB is? In this session you will explore a popular\nalternative to the RDBMS called Mongo from one who has battled with BSON\nto write the original .Net driver. You'll learn basics of schema design,\ndocument manipulation, several ways to get at your data, something odd\ncalled map/reduce and all from the comfort of Python and the slightly\nuncomfortable IronPython.\n",
