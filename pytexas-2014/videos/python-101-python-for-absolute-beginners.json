  "description": "If you're absolutely new to Python, and to programming in general, this\nis the place to start!\n\nHere's the breakdown: by the end of this workshop, you'll have Python\ndownloaded onto your personal machine; have a general idea of what\nPython can help you do; be pointed in the direction of some excellent\npractice materials; and have a basic understanding of the syntax of the\nlanguage.\n\nPlease don't forget to bring your laptop!\n\nAudience: \"Python 101\" is geared toward individuals who are new to\nprogramming. If you've had some programming experience (shell scripting,\nMATLAB, Ruby, etc.), then you'll probably want to check out the more\nintermediate workshop, \"Python 101++\".\n",
