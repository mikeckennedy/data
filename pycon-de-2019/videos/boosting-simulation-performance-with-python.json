  "description": "Speaker: Eran Friedman\n\nTrack:PyConDE\nIn this talk I will present the architecture of our simulation (written in Python) which allows us to simulate hours of real-life in only minutes of simulation. I will describe challenges we encountered and how we handled them.\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2019 conference.\nhttps://pycon.de\n\nMore details at the conference page: https://de.pycon.org/program/CEYMMK\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pyconde",
