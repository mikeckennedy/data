  "description": "\u201cCode shortening\u201d is the \u201csport\u201d where participants strive to achieve\nthe shortest possible source code that solves a programming problem by\nexploiting all the tricks and quirks of the language.\n\nThe `SIZECON problem <http://www.spoj.com/problems/SIZECON>`__ on SPOJ\nis one of the oldest and most popular code shortening problems on the\nweb with a bizarre twist, only character above ASCII value 32 are\ncounted for the penalty. During the talk we will take a journey into\nsome frightening depths of the Python language in order to write shorter\nand shorter solutions to SIZECON until, exploiting a number of\nmind-blowing tricks, we will reach the current record solution for\nPython 3 of 31 characters.\n\nI promise I\u2019ll show you the most obfuscated, contrived and sick python\ncode you have ever seen and (hopefully!) will ever see. I invite\nparticipants to give `SIZECON <http://www.spoj.com/problems/SIZECON>`__\na try and check their score against the `Python3\nrankings <http://www.spoj.com/ranks/SIZECON/lang=PYTH%203.2.3>`__.\n\nThis is an updated version of a talk I presented during Europython 2015\nand that had an unexpected success both on-site and on social media. The\ntalk is now centred on Python 3 shorting tricks and is has been reworked\nto be much more easy to follow.\n",
