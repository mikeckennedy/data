  "description": "At the December 2018 Python Frederick event, Patrick walked through the second half of the Django 2.1 tutorial. Since Patrick is a DevOps engineer instead of a web developer, the group got to share in the experience in a novice.\n\nThe Django tutorial is very large so we picked up from where we left off from the previous presentation. If you want to watch that experience, check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSs2eZ-yFps",
