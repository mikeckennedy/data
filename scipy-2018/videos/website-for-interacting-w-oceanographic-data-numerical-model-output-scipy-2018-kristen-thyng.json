  "description": "The Texas Automated Buoy System (TABS) has been recording and serving\nonline velocity and other in situ water data since 1995. We have\nrecently modernized the website to include more data and operational\nnumerical model output, and to improve ease of use. This effort relies\nheavily on Python for plotting and data handling, especially relying on\npackages pandas for reading in and manipulating data, and matplotlib for\nplotting. The website includes an interactive map with data overlaid on\nmodel output and combines the robustness of the leaflet library with the\nflexibility of svg vectorial plotting and graphical objects\nmanipulation.Presenter(s): Speaker: Kristen Thyng, Assistant Research\nScientist, Texas A&M; University Speaker: Martinho Marta-Almeida\n",
