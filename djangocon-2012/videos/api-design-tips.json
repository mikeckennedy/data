This is even more\namplified if you work on OSS, where people *will* use it in ways you've\nnever dreamed about.\n\nThis talk is a reflection on my experience building libraries for other\npeople's consumption & thoughts on how to design/make (non-HTTP) APIs in\na way that will make others love you (or at least not hunt you down &\nstrangle you).\n",
