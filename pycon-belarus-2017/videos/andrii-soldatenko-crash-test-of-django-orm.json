  "description": "The world is swimming in articles and books about Django and Django ORM\nitself. All this sources cover only basic use cases of Django ORM\ncomparing to real world examples. This talk is dedicated to the\nproposition to crash test Django ORM 80% of functionalities in 20% of\nthe time. Also I\u2019m going to show the important features and capabilities\nof Django ORM compare to most of SQL features. Traditionally, ORM is\npresented in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d fashion, but I would like to propose\napproach, on the other hand, is \u201ctop-down\u201d. We begin by identifying a\nrather short list of standard questions, or precisely types of\nquestions, that are often asked of relations databases. We then show how\nthese standard questions are posted in Django ORM, introducing and\nmotivating the use of its capabilities and features as they become\nrelevant.\n",
