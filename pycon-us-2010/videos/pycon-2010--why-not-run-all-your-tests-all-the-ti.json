  "description": "Why not run all your tests at all the time? A study of continuous\nintegration systems\n\nPresented by Dr. C. Titus Brown (Michigan State University)\n\nThere are an increasing number of continuous integration (CI) systems\navailable for use by Pythonistas, but no clear guide to how to choose a\nCI system for your project. I will examine the architecture choices made\nby buildbot, bitten, Hudson, continuum, CruiseControl, DART, and\npony-build, and discuss the configuration and customization of several\nof these systems for Pythonic needs, as well as give short demos (for\nbuildbot, bitten, Hudson, and pony-build).\n",
