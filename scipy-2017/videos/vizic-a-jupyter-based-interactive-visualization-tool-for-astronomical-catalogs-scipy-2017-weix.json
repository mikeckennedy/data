  "description": "In the face of ever-growing datasets in astronomical sky surveys, we present Vizic, a Python/JavaScript library designed for Jupyter Notebook, which visualizes astronomical catalogs and presents them in vectorized form inside widgets in Jupyter notebooks. Visualized catalogs are fully interactive under a tiled web map approach. Vizic provides a unique and efficient way to visualize and explore multiple catalogs through interactive object filtering, color mapping, zooming and data selection using a lasso-like tool. In addition, custom overlays such as Voronoi layer can assist astronomers to visualize and interact with cosmic structures. At the end of this talk, we will give a brief demo to illustrate the potentials of Vizic in scientific research.\n",
