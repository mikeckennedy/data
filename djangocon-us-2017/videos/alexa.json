  "description": "As the universe of IoT continues to grow at a rapid pace, our abilities to interact with these devices can be useful. As an added bonus, developing these skills can be fun too!\n\nI\u2019ll take you through my journey of developing my first Alexa skill in Python for Amazon Echo devices aptly named Happy Days. It is a random quote generator that delivers positive quotes. I\u2019ll go over the skills of how to get Python to talk to Alexa and how to dump that code into Lambda for a seamless delivery between Amazon Web Services and the Alexa Skills Kit in just a little over 200 lines! Never developed an Alexa skill before? Don\u2019t worry, I hadn\u2019t either. I\u2019ll provide plenty of resources to help get you started on a path you\u2019ll never want to leave as an Alexa developer.\n\nhttps://2017.djangocon.us/talks/alexa/",
