  "summary": "When a web application is large, it's a good idea to send different\nkinds of requests to different servers to reduce the content corpus\nmanaged by each server. A decentralized load balancing-based approach is\npresented in which each application server keeps track of what it's good\nat and presents its resume to load balancers, which use application\nserver resumes to distribute load.\n",
