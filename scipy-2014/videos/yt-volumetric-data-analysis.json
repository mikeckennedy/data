  "summary": "yt started as a tool for visualizing data from astrophysical\nsimulations, but it has evolved into a method for analyzing generic\nvolumetric data. In this talk we will present yt 3.0, which includes an\nincreased focus on inquiry-driven analysis and visualization, a\nsympy-powered unit system, a revised user interface, and the ability to\nscale to petabyte datasets and tens of thousands of cores.\n",
