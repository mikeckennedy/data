Single brain, single pair of hands, single keyboard, but a different keyboard layout for each language and a different text editor for each purpose?\n\n**Description**\n\nDo you use an IDE to work on Python code, then switch to an e-mail client to write a message, then open a different editor to work on the documentation and finally ssh to a remote server to edit a configuration file? Do you switch languages frequently or are your colleagues named M\u00fcller, Fran\u00e7ois, Mu\u00f1oz or even \u0160ediv\u00fd?\n\nI'll show you how I am happily typing in several languages on a single standard US keyboard layout and why my CapsLock became so useful.\n\nI'll show you how I use a single editor on all my machines to produce all sorts of text, especially Python code with a few useful plugins.\n\nI'll show you my own plugin written in Python to hack my e-mails far beyond imagination.\n\n\n**Recorded at** PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: https://de.pycon.org/\n\n**Video editing**: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\n\n**Tools**: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",
