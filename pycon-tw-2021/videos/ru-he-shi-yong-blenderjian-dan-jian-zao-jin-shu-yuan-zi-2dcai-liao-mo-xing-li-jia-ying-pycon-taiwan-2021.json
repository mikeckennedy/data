However they are often required to rely on expensive commercial software to produce images of their results and these have limited flexibility.\n\nBlender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics, animation and rendering software toolset which is run via python scripting and a python-based GUI. It is already easy to use, and there is a wealth of on-line help material available in videos, forums, and a Stack Exchange site of its own.\n\nMany python programmers and scientists are not aware of Blender and how easy it is to use, so I will give short demonstrations and walk through example scripts so that viewers will be much more likely to go ahead, download Blender and get started with Python scripting right away.\n\nMy demo will show the input specified parameters (such as: how many layers, is a hexagonal or a honeycomb , what is the lattice constant, the size of the particles, how much strain is applied, etc.) to construct the required 2D material model\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\nHackMD: https://hackmd.io/@pycontw/2021/%2F%40pycontw%2Fr1TISbFGF\n\nSpeaker: \u674e\u5609\u7a4e\n\npython \u5165\u9580\u8005",
