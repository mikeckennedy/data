Glancing at them from a distance, one might\nhave to squint a bit to see a pattern emerge. In truth, the community\ndoesn\u2019t mind that at all, out of the variety comes innovation. Beyond\nthe logos and stickers, what is this community actually doing?\n\nI present the various projects and argue that we have inadvertently\ncreated one of the most successful data science platforms in existence.\nFrom this vantage point, I pose some tough questions the community needs\nto answer: How can we present that platform more fully? How should we\norganize ourselves to make our work more valuable? How do we avoid a\ncollapse of our communities?\n",
