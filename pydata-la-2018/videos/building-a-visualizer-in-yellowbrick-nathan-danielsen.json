  "abstract": "I\u2019m going to go through a typical workflow for developing a new\nvisualizer for the Yellowbrick library including writing tests including\nvisual unit tests and mocking. A visualizer extend the Scikit-Learn API\nto allow you to visually steer the modeling process. Along the way, I\u2019m\ngoing to talk about some great utilities that are included in\nscikit-learn, matplotlib and numpy that might make your life easier.\n\nYellowbrick is a machine learning visualization library with the end\ngoal of allowing data scientists to visually steer the model selection\nprocess through the production of high quality and information\nvisualizations. Under the hood, Yellowbrick is built primarily on\nscikit-learn and matplotlib with a bit of numpy to glue it all together.\n",
