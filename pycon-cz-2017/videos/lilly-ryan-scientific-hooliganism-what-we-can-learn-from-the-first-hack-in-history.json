  "description": "In 1903, Guglielmo Marconi prepared to unveil his world-first,\nlong-distance wireless communication technology to the Royal\nInstitution in London. He was looking forward to roaring success,\nscientific acclaim, and a string of wealthy new customers - but he\ndidn\u2019t count upon falling victim to the first hack in history.\n\nThis is a tale of business secrets, flame wars, stage magic, and\nmagnificent sideburns, direct from the records of Edwardian England.\n\nThe talk highlights several of the lessons that the FLOSS and\ninformation security communities can still learn from the fateful\nevents of 1903. Marconi\u2019s tale is a master class in the necessity of\nopen source technology, as well as being a delightful introduction to\nthe art of vulnerability reporting.",
