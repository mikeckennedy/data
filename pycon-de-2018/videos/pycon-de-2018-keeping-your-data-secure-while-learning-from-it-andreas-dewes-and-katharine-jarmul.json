  "description": "We will discuss anonymization and pseudonymization techniques that you\ncan apply to your data to keep it secure and comply with the law(s)\nwhile still being able to gain useful insights from it.\n\nWe will show concrete Python implementations of various techniques and\nuse example data sets to show how applying pseudonymization and\nanonymization will affect our ability to do machine learning / data\nscience.\n",
