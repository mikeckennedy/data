  "summary": "Authors: Pedersen, Brent; University of Colorado\n\nTrack: Bioinformatics\n\nAfter traditional bioinformatic analyses, we are often left with a set\nof genomic regions; for example: ChIP-Seq peaks, transcription-factor\nbinding sites, differentially methylated regions, or sites of\nloss-of-heterozygosity. This talk will go over the difficulties commonly\nencountered at this stage of an investigation and cover some additional\nanalyses, using python libraries, that can help to provide insight into\nthe function of a set of intervals. Some of the libraries covered will\nbe pybedtools, cruzdb, pandas, and shuffler. The focus will be on\nannotation, exploratory data analysis and calculation of simple\nenrichment metrics with those tools. The format will be a walk-through\n(in the IPython notebook) of a set of these analyses that utilizes\nENCODE and other publicly available data to annotate an example dataset.\n",
