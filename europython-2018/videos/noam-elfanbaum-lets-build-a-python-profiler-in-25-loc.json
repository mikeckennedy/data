  "description": "A profile is a set of statistics that describes how often and for how\nlong various parts of the program executed. Most profilers run inside\nyour Python process. If you\u2019re inside a Python program you generally\nhave pretty easy access to its stack, hence we can gather information\nabout time spent in each level.\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll build a Python profiler from scratch and so learn\nabout the dynamic nature of Python and how do well-known profilers such\nas cProfile.\n\nWe\u2019ll also learn the difference between a tracing and a sampling\nprofiler and which one to use in what circumstance.\n",
