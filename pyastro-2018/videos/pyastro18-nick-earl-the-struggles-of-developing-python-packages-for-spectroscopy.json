  "description": "An overview of some of the challenges faced in developing spectroscopic open-source packages for the astronomy community, and what we've done to try and overcome them. The talk discusses three spectroscopy-focused packages at different stages of development and how we plan to ensure community traction while working under bureaucratic constraints, building in inter-operatibility with other python packages, and providing accessibility for contributors of a wide range of programming backgrounds.\n",
