  "summary": "This talk is an introduction to the practice of exception handling,\naimed at those without a heavy CS background or years of experience, and\nwho are thus unfamiliar with the technique. Novices to Python will learn\nPython-specific techniques that make use of built-in exceptions and the\ncontext manager, as well as unusual but Pythonic ways of managing the\nflow control of their program.\n",
