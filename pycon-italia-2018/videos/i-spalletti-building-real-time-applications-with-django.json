  "description": "Since the introduction of Channels, real time web has become much easier\nto work with in Django. It\u2019s now possible to build real time\napplications with much less effort in managing the idiosyncrasies of the\nasync programming and a lot of batteries are included. Starting with a\nbrief introduction to Channels, we will see how to build a real time\napplication, both on the Django and the frontend side and how easy it\u2019s\nto start experimenting with it. The talk has a very hands-on approach,\nto allow the attendees to experiment with the proposed solution and\napproach and starting immediately building their own real time\napplications with Django.\n\nin \\_\\_on **venerd\u00ec 20 aprile** at 14:30 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
