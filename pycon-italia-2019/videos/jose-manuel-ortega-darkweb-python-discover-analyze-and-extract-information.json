  "description": "The talk will start explaining how Tor project can help us to the\nresearch and development of tools for online anonymity and privacy of\nits users while surfing the Internet, by establishing virtual circuits\nbetween the different nodes that make up the Tor network. In addition,\nwe will review how Tor works from anonymity point of view, preventing\nwebsites from tracking you. Python help us to automate the process to\nsearch an discover hidden services thanks to packages like\nrequests,requesocks and sockspy. At this point we will review the\ncrawling process and show tools in python ecosystem available for this\ntask such as Deep Explorer(https://github.com/blueudp/deep-explorer).\n\nThese could be the talking points:\n\n-  Introduction to Tor project and hidden services\n\n-  Discovering hidden services.\n\n-  Modules and packages we can use in python for connecting with Tor\n   network\n\n-  Tools that allow search hidden services and atomate the crawling\n   process in Tor network\n\nFeedback form: https://python.it/feedback-1563\n\nin \\_\\_on **Saturday 4 May** at 12:15 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
