  "description": "Dask is a flexible tool for parallelizing Python code on a single\nmachine or across a cluster. It builds upon familiar tools in the SciPy\necosystem (e.g. NumPy and Pandas) while allowing them to scale across\nmultiple cores or machines. This tutorial will cover both the high-level\nuse of dask collections, as well as the low-level use of dask graphs and\nschedulers.Presenter(s): Speaker: James Crist, Anaconda, Inc. Speaker:\nMartin Durant, Anaconda Inc.\n",
