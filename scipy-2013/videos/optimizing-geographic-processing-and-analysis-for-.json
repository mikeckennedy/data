  "summary": "Authors: Brittain, Carissa, GeoDecisions; Gleason, Jason, GeoDecisions\n\nTrack: GIS - Geospatial Data Analysis\n\nConsidering performance becomes more and more important as the size of\ndatasets increase. Many factors, some outside a developer's control, can\nseriously impact performance; sometimes to the point that a processing\nscript or database becomes unusable. The example discussed here is an\narcpy geoprocessing script that required more than 26 hrs to process and\nload 24 hrs of wind velocity data from across the United States.\nChanging the script to apply basic optimization strategies reduced that\nprocessing time to under an hour. Benchmark tests and database\ninspection while applying each strategy showed the results of each\nchange and allowed for calculating each change's impact on the final\nperformance. Understanding and applying even basic optimization methods\ncan have a large return on effort when working with large datasets and\ncan have a significant impact on processing time.\n",
