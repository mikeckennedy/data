  "description": "Qt is a mature C++ framework for building cross-platform, native GUI\napplications that target Windows, Mac, Linux, mobile, and embedded\nplatforms. PyQt (and PySide) provides python bindings for the Qt\nlibrary, and allows one to quickly and easily build GUI applications in\npure Python. While web-based and mobile development gets all the\nattention these days, there are still many use-cases for which native\napps are much more suitable. Qt provides an extremely rich and\nwell-designed set of classes to build complex user interfaces both\nvisually (with Qt Designer) and programmatically, and PyQt makes\nbuilding native apps incredibly fast and easy. This tutorial will\nintroduce the main ideas and modules in Qt and how the bindings work,\nand demonstrate building an application from scratch with PyQt.\n",
