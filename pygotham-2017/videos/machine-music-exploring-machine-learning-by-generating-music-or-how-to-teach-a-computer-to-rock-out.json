  "description": "This talk will go through the ups and downs of a machine learning    beginner trying to create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to implement    a music generating algorithm. We will build off of Gabe\u2019s PyGotham 2016    talk (The Sounds Of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb9c\\_WFMYeI)    and will attempt to implement an RNN based on Alex Graves\u2019 GeneratingSequences With Recurrent Neural Networks    (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf).\n\nGabe Levine is a `musician`_    turned `software engineer`_, and Jonathan Arfa is a `Statistics and     Machine Learning enthusiast`_\n\n.. _musician: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12049-migration/\n.. _software engineer: https://github.com/gabelev\n.. _Statistics and Machine Learning enthusiast: https://github.com/jarfa",
