  "description": "The world is not perfect and network failures do happen. Complaining\nabout instability might not always be enough. Especially when your\nsystem depends on multiple networked services and each of them is on\na critical path to the final result.\n\nIn this talk we will recall why network failures happen. Reason what\nwe can and cannot handle in the code. And see what Python standard\nlibraries and a few popular ones such as urllib3 and requests can\noffer.\n\nAnd that's not all. Network Emulation (netem) module of Linux Traffic\nControl (tc) can even help with poor network simulation.\n\nNow there is no excuse.",
