  "description": "Python's design makes it easy to create small programs to handle all\nkinds of tasks. Tools like Github make it easy (and free!) to share\ncode with the world. However, code that solves a problem on your local\nmachine may not directly translate to solving the same problem for\nsomeone else. This talk will provide basic practices and guidelines\nfor making your code usable and accessible to others.\n\nPython makes it easy to create small programs to handle all kinds of\ntasks, and tools like Github make it easy and free to share code with\nthe world. However, simply adding a \\*.py to a Github repository (or\nworse: a zip file on your personal website) doesn't mean other Python\nprogrammers will be able to run and use your code.\n\nFor years, I've written one-off scripts and small programs to automate\npersonal tasks and satisfy my curiosity. Until recently, I was never\ncomfortable sharing this code online. In this talk, I will share good\npractices I've learned and developed for sharing my small projects\nonline.\n\nThe talk will include tips on writing reusable scripts, the basics of\nGit and Github, the importance of READMEs and software licenses, and\ncreation of reproducible Python environments with Conda.\n\nBesides making your code more usable and accessible to others, the\ntips in this talk will help you make your Github profile a valuable\ncomponent of your online r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and open the door for others to\nimprove your programs through Github pull requests.",
