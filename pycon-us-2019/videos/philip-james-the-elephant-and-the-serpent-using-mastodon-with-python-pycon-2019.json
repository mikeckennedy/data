  "description": "For the past two years, an Open Source social network has been building\non the foundations laid by years of Open Web work and quietly growing to\nprovide a viable alternative to the social network megacorps we\u2019ve grown\nused to. It\u2019s name is Mastodon, and it wants you to be part of the\ncommunity.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll learn what Mastodon is, how it works, how you can\nparticipate, and how you can interact with the community using Python.\nAlong the way, we\u2019ll learn about OAuth, APIs, and best practices for\nwriting bots. Attendees will walk away with the knowledge of how to\nbuild a Mastodon bot.\n",
