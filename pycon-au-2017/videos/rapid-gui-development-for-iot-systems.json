And gives full access to the jHipster ecosystem.\nUsing webpages as an interface to embedded hardware is one of those mythical cases that combines the advantages of both while smashing the disadvantages.\n\nThe demonstrated system will use a stripped down web browser for the front end.\nPython's Tornado framework to do the work.\nTransport is by majestic single horned galloping websockets.\n\nThe structure allows for rapid development, considerable flexibility and expansion, and network based control is almost free.",
