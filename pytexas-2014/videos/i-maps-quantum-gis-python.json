  "description": "Quantum GIS (QGIS) is an open-source, highly customizable geospatial\napplication that's great for data exploration, manipulation, and\ncartographic preparation -- in other words, it's software that allows\nyou to make detailed, aesthetically-pleasing maps for free!\n\nQGIS is also *extremely* script-able with Python, and integrates with a\nlarge number of database and analysis backends (GRASS, R, PostGIS,\netc.). In this talk, Paige Bailey will be giving a short overview of\nQGIS; detailing a few mapping case studies; then showing how to leverage\nadditional functionality by writing custom Python plugins.\n",
