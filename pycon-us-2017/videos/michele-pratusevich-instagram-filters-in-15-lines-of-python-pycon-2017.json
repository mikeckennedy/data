  "description": "Images tell stories, and we love Instagram filters because they give\nemotion to our images. Do you want to explore what makes up Instagram\nfilters? In this talk, we will talk about the basic elements of\nInstagram filters and implement them in Python. The staple libraries we\nwill use are scikit-image and numpy - matplotlib and jupyter notebooks\nfor plotting and interactivity. In the end, we will implement the\n(now-defunct) Gotham Instagram filter in 15 lines of Python (not\nincluding imports). Throughout the process, there will be many pretty\npictures.\n",
