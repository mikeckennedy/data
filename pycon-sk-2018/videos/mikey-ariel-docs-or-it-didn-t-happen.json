  "description": "If you ever skimmed through a README, tried to follow a quickstart\ntutorial, attempted to decipher an error message, or typed '--help' in\nyour terminal, congratulations -- you have encountered documentation!\n\nLong gone are the days of massive books with never-ending stories about\nyour software. Today's users are smarter and less patient, which means\nthat we no longer need to document *all the things*, as long as what we\ndo document is clear, concise, helpful, and accessible. And that's where\nthe real work starts.\n\nDocumentation requires some attitude adjustment, since prose doesn't\nneatly compile into binaries as code does. But Don't Panic(tm)! No\nmatter what your role is in the community, you can apply a few key\nprinciples from the technical writing world to make your project more\ndocs-friendly, and therefore more user- and contributor-friendly.\n\nThis high-level (and all-level) talk aims to introduce or re-acquaint\nyou with topics such as content strategy, docs-as-code, optimized DevOps\nfor docs, and contribution workflows. Open-source projects of all\nshapes, ages, sizes are welcome!\n",
