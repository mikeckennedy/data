  "description": "This talk distills information from the open source guide `Full Stack\nPython <http://www.fullstackpython.com/>`__ I wrote into a 30 minute\ntalk on web stack layers. An approximate timeline for this talk would\nbe:\n\n-  5 min: intro story\n-  5 min: what the web developers need to know about virtual servers,\n   web servers, and WSGI servers\n-  5 min: what do web frameworks provide?\n-  5 min: what are the most important parts of your web application to\n   analyze and monitor?\n-  5 min: static files and execution on the user's browser\n-  5 min: concluding story and resources to learn more\n\nThis is a high level overview intended for developers who are new to\nPython web development and need to understand what the web stack layers\nare and how they fit together.\n",
