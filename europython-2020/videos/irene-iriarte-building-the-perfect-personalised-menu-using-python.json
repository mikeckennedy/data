  "description": "How Gousto is building an algorithm to offer personalised menus to their customers using python\n\nThis talk will describe how Gousto, a leading recipe box service based in the UK, is using python to build a personalisation ecosystem. Our menu planning optimisation algorithm allows us to create the perfect mix of recipes, ensuring a variety of dish types, cuisines and ingredients. Our recommendation engine sitting on top of this can then offer each customer a personally curated menu, making sure that users have meaningful choice. All this while ensuring that we are also optimising for maximum performance from the operations point of view! \r\n\r\nTo build this, we have used a range of Python packages, such as DEAP for implementing genetic algorithms, and integrations, such as the one for graph database neo4j. \r\n\r\nThe talk will give an overview of our methods, our infrastructure, our results and everything that we have learnt along the way!",
