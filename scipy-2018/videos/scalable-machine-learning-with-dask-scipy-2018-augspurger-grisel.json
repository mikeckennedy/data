  "description": "This talk demonstrates how to scale a Python-based machine learning\nworkflow to larger models and larger datasets. The talk will introduce a\ncommon workflow using NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, and discuss some\nchallenges with scaling that workflow out to larger datasets. We'll then\nsee how dask and dask-ml work with and extend these libraries to enable\nlarge-scale parallel and distributed machine learning.Presenter(s):\nSpeaker: Tom Augspurger, Anaconda, Inc. Speaker: Olivier Grisel, INRIA\n",
