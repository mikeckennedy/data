  "description": "In this talk I show off some of the ways I've made my elementary school homework more interesting using various pieces of python. This ranges from automating the generation of \"factor trees\", which became a script that generated at least 10 different images creating a giant poster of information that barely works, to writing an entire 3d engine from scratch for a project to model a backyard. The code behind these endeavors is sometimes crazy, and often has a pretty funny story behind it. At least it\u2019s better than whatever garbage that a block based programming tool educators keep pushing on me will create! I will also be posting all the code (as well as some that didn't make the talk) in a giant git repository on my github afterwards.",
