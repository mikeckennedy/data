  "description": "I plan to briefly introduce pip requirements files and the wheel format.\nI will then demonstrate an approach for structuring requirements files,\nusing \"snapshot\" requirement files, and building \"wheelhouses\" that get\ncommitted to your VCS. This approach has the following benefits:\n\n-  known working & tested dependencies are clearly communicated between\n   developers\n-  project setup for new developers is simplified\n-  build servers no longer throw erroneous errors if PyPI is down\n-  production environments no longer need build tools installed on them\n-  production environments are guaranteed to be running on the same\n   version of dependencies that were developed on and tested\n\n",
