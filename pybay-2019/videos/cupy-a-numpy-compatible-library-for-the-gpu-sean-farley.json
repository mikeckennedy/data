  "description": "This talk was presented at PyBay2019 - 4th annual Bay Area Regional Python conference. See pybay.com for more details about PyBay and click SHOW MORE for more information about this talk.\n\nDescription\nThis workshop will have four or so Lego Mindstorms that we'll use to learn how to program a Mindstorm to use its camera to follow a racetrack made out of tape.\n\nAbstract\nUsing a real-time OS, we will learn about computer vision using the tools made by Lego. Time permitting, we will then remove parts of the racetrack and use machine learning to improve our race car.\n\nAbout the speaker\nSean is a tech advocate for Preferred Networks, a Berkeley-based robotics company. He teaches python and machine learning, writes tutorials, and connects with the greater developer community in the Bay Area. In his spare time, he enjoys volunteering at PyLadies, hacking on open source, and traveling.\n\nSponsor Acknowledgement\nThis and other PyBay2019 videos are via the help of our media partner AlphaVoice (https://www.alphavoice.io/)!\n\n#pybay #pybay2019 #python #python3",
