  "description": "Azure Machine Learning: Predict Who Survives the Titanic\n\nInterested in doing machine learning in the cloud? In this demo, Jennifer Marsman will set the stage with some information on the different types of machine learning (clustering, classification, regression, and anomaly detection) supported by Azure Machine Learning and when to use each. Then, for the majority of the session, she\u2019ll demonstrate using Azure Machine Learning to build a model which predicts survival of individuals on the Titanic (one of the challenges on the Kaggle website). She'll talk through how she analyzes the given data and why she chooses to drop or modify certain data, so you will see the entire process from data import to data cleaning to building, training, testing, and deploying a model. You\u2019ll leave with practical knowledge on how to get started and build your own predictive models using Azure Machine Learning.\n\n----\n\nJennifer Marsman is a Principal Software Development Engineer in Microsoft\u2019s Developer Experience group, where she educates developers on Microsoft\u2019s new technologies with a focus on data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
