  "description": "There are many reasons why I think pytest is a fantastic test framework:\nassertion introspection, setup and teardown with fixtures, parametrized\ntests. But plugins are the real game changer!\n\nWe'll dive right into customizing a test suite by developing a series of\npytest plugins based on a few neat hacks. We'll learn how to\nautomatically add markers to slow running tests, run only tests that use\na fixture which can be specified on the CLI, generate test reports in a\ncustom format, and automatically create GitHub issues for test\nregressions. We'll wrap up this talk by using Cookiecutter to create\nPython packages from our plugins that are ready to be published on PyPI.",
