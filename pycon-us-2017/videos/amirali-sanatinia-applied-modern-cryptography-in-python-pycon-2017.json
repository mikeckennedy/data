  "description": "Today we use cryptography in almost everywhere. From surfing the web\nover https, to working remotely over ssh. Although most developers don't\nneed to implement cryptography primitives, the knowledge and\nunderstanding of these building block allows them to better deploy them\nin their application. In modern crypto we have all the building block to\ndevelop secure application. However, we see instances of insecure code\neverywhere. Most of these vulnerabilities are not because of theoretic\nshortcomings, but due to bad implementation or a flawed protocol design.\nCryptography is a delicate art where nuances matter, and failure to\ncomprehend the subtleties of these building blocks leads to critical\nvulnerabilities. To add insult to injury most of the resources available\nare either outdated or wrong, and inarguably, using bad crypto more\ndangerous than not using it.\n\nIn this tutorial we look at the basic building blocks of modern\ncryptography. We will cover the encryption techniques, hashing\nmechanisms, and key devastation algorithms. Furthermore we review two of\nthe most widely used protocol suites, SSL and PGP. We conclude by\nimplementing a simplified version of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), that is\nused for encryption of texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole\ndisk partitions.\n",
