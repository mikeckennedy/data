  "description": "/me wants it. Scraping sites to get data.\n\nPresented by Robert Coup\n\nAbstract\n\nBuilding scrapers for grabbing data from websites. Tools, techniques,\nand tips.\n\nOutline\n\nLife would be so much easier if the data contained in websites was\navailable raw via APIs. Alas, until that mythical day comes we either\nneed to deal with unhelpful people via email and phone, or just get it\nourselves. Python has some great tools available to help with building\nscrapers and for parsing and formatting the data we get. Starting off\nwith the basics - tracking what needs to be done, making web requests,\nparsing HTML, following links, and extricating data from Excel and PDF\ndocuments. Our scraper needs to be resilient against too-clever content\nmanagement systems, Frontpage-era HTML, and plain dodgy data. We may\nneed to pass through logins and other messiness. There are some\ntechniques and tips for approaching the problems and keeping your\nsolution flexible and as simple as possible. We'll discuss some scrapers\nbuilt for New Zealand data, and introduce a new project from the NZ open\ngovernment data group to provide a RESTful interface to scrapers -\neffectively creating a nice API where there isn't one.\n\nSlides:\n`http://www.slideshare.net/rcoup/me-wants-it-scraping-sites-to-get-\ndata <http://www.slideshare.net/rcoup/me-wants-it-scraping-sites-to-get-data>`__\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.
