  "description": "Introduction to the clean code principles tailored for Python\nprojects. The goal is to achieve better code quality and a more\nmaintainable code base. Python has a nature of being clear, and easy\nto follow, so let's take advantage of it in our own code, in order to\nenforce the principle \"readability counts\" by writing pythonic code.\n\nThis talk introduces general concepts of code quality for Python\ndevelopers, analyzing technical debt, with examples on how to achieve\na more legible, maintainable and clean code base, by refactoring,\nwriting unit tests and having good coding guidelines for the project.\nIf you are giving your first steps with Python, you will gain insight\non best practices for writing good software from the start. If you\nare a experienced developer, the ideas should work as food for\nthought, helping with recommendations for code reviews, best\npractices, etc.\n\n------\n\nMariano is a software engineer and technical leader, keen on open\nsource, state-of-the-art technology, focused on Python development,\nDevOps and experienced in back-end projects.\n\nMariano's main areas of interests besides Python are Linux, software\narchitecture, distributed systems and speaking at conferences.",
