  "description": "Inputs is a brand new module published in 2016 but it is already\ngaining some traction. The inputs module provides cross-platform\nPython support for keyboards, mice, gamepads, touch screens, wiimotes,\nbuttons, switches and pretty much any other input device you might\nwant to use. Currently supported platforms are the Raspberry Pi,\nLinux, Windows and the Apple Mac. The talk is suitable for everyone.\nThe inputs module is very high level and suitable for complete\nbeginners to programming, I will also explain very briefly for more\nadvanced developers how to support a new class of device, but not in a\nboring way.\n\nIn a light-hearted fashion, I will demonstrate how to use the inputs[1]\nmodule and will demonstrate some embedded/Internet of Things use\ncases, a digital signage use case and some more comical, imaginative\nand entertaining applications of the module.\n\n[1] https://pypi.python.org/pypi/inputs\n",
