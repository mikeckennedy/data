  "description": "We discuss two different approaches to building web services using\nPython. The first and more traditional approach uses Flask to build a\nweb service, while the second approach builds a web service using only\nnative Python 2.7 libraries without dependencies on any additional\nsoftware.\n\nThe talk starts by discussing web services in general before moving onto\nthe different environments our services run in, and what they will be\nused for. We will briefly cover the code used, but the focus will be on\nthe reason why we need two different approaches and we will compare the\nrisks and benefits of using these two contrasting methods.\n\nWe hope the talk will inspire people to experiment even further with web\nservices, or at least give them insight into new ways they could use web\nservices.\n",
