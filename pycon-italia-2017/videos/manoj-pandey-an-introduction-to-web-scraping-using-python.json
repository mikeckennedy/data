  "description": "Web scraping is a technique for gathering data or information on web\npages. You could revisit your favorite web site every time it updates\nfor new information. Or you could write a web scraper to have it do it\nfor you!\n\nWant to learn how to scrape the web (and / or organized data sets and\nAPIs) for content? This talk will give you the building blocks (and\ncode) to begin your own scraping adventures. We will review basic data\nscraping, API usage, form submission as well as how to scrape pesky bits\nlike Javascript-usage for DOM manipulation.\n\nBesides looking at how websites are put together, we will also discuss\nthe ethics of scraping. What is legal? How can you be a friendly\nscraper, so that the administrator of the website you are scraping won\u2019t\ntry to shut you down?\n",
