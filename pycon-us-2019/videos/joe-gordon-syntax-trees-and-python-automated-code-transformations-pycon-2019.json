  "description": "Manually updating a million line code base is tedious. Thankfully syntax\ntrees provide a safe and quick way to automatically apply repetitive\ntransformations. Leveraging syntax tree based tooling (based on\nlib2to3), has been a critical component of Pinterest's Python 3 upgrade\nstrategy, and saved us countless hours of work. Learn how syntax trees\nwork, how they are used to transform code, and how you can quickly write\nyour own transformations.\n",
