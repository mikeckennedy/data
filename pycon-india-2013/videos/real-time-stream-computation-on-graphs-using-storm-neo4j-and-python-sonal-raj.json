  "description": "Storm\n~~~~~\n\nWe will briefly outline the installation and features of Twitter\u2019s Storm\nframework and basic operations which make it an ideal tool for real-time\nstream processing of data. We will also look into it's Fault-Tolerance\ncapabilities using programmatic implementations.\n\nNeo4J\n~~~~~\n\nWe will briefly introduce Neo4j, a No-SQL graph Database \u2013 how it works,\nits APIs, working with REST and Cypher.\n\nDistributed Graph Operations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe shall then focus on how Storm and Neo4J can be made to work in co-\nordination in a distributed environment to produce efficient and fast\noperations on significantly large graph data. The session will also\ninclude a live implementation of a scenario to demonstrate the use of\nStorm, Neo4J and their co-ordinated jobs in Python.\n\nFinally the growing social applications of graph databases will not be a\nmystery anymore !",
