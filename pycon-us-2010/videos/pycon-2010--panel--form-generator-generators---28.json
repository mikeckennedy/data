Some have straight\nforward techniques, some are unique or even an unusual approach to the\nproblem. The question is: \"what can we learn from each other?\". This\npanel will examine the different ways developers generate forms by\noffering examples, and summarizing the functionality, differences, and\nsimilarities between these valuable web development tools.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Feedback galore when moving between mics, cover your\nears]\n",
