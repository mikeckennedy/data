  "description": "Speakers: Michael Tom-Wing, Christie Wilson\n\nIn this tutorial we\u2019ll be taking you on a journey into the wonderful land of unit testing with pytest. We\u2019ll be taking a step by step approach by iteratively adding unit test coverage to our awesome Cat In A Box\u2122 project. You will also get a crash course on Git, Github, virtualenvs, and test automation. By the end, we hope that you\u2019ll have a desire to bring testing to our own projects!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
