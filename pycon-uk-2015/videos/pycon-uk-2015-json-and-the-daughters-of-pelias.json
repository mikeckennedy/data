  "description": "The JSON Data Interchange Format is Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) standard RFC-7159. Since its release, many new draft internet\nstandards have been published including JSON Schema\n(draft-zyp-json-schema-04), JSOND (draft- oskarsson-jsond-00), JSON\nPointer (RFC-6901), JSON-LD (W3C Recommendation), JSON Merge Patch\n(RFC-7386), JSON-RPC and JSON Reference (draft-pbryan-zyp- json-ref-03);\nwhile new Python object to JSON serialisation techniques have been\npublished such as jsonpickle.\n\nIn this session we will implement these JSON technologies using Python\nand evaluate their individual usefulness but also discuss how these\nproposals can and cannot be combined to make JSON powered Python\napplications. Finally, we will look at a Python application that I made\nusing some of these technologies.",
