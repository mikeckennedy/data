  "description": "We are building a Python wrapper for the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), a\nset of command-line programs used across the Earth, Atmospheric, and\nOcean Sciences to process and visualize geographic data. At Scipy 2017,\nwe presented the project goals and an initial prototype. The feedback\nreceived led to improvements in the design of the library, mainly the\ncreation of an object- oriented API. We will present the newest\ndevelopments including support for numpy arrays and pandas Dataframes,\ninteractive visualization in the Jupyter notebook using NASA WorldWind,\nand more. Once again, we seek feedback from the community to guide us\nmoving forward.Presenter(s): Speaker: Leonardo Uieda, Department of\nGeology and Geophysics, University of Hawaii at Manoa Speaker: Paul\nWessel, Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of Hawaii at\nManoa\n",
