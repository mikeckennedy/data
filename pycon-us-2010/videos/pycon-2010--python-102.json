  "description": "Python 102\n\nPresented by Stuart Williams\n\nThis half-day tutorial presents intermediate and some advanced features\nof Python to beginning and intermediate programmers. It pairs well with\nPython 101 which follows a similar outline but at a more introductory\nlevel.\n\nRather than starting with \"Hello, world!\", we use the interactive Python\ninterpreter shell to get hands-on familiarity with much of core Python\nbefore covering blocks and scripts.\n\nThe tutorial is divided into short sections, each with presentation and\nhands- on exercises, to quickly cover lots of ground.\n\nAdvanced topics are introduced throughout and covered in \"extra credit\"\nexercises such that more advanced participants can learn at their own\npace.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nProgrammers with experience in other languages who want a fast hands-on\nintroduction to intermediate and some advanced features of Python.\nContent will target both Python 3.1 and 2.6.\n\nClass Outline\n\n-  Numbers and Strings - operators, functions and methods\n-  Introspection\n-  Sequences - overview, concepts, and methods\n-  Objects\n-  Dictionaries\n-  Files\n-  Classes\n-  Namespaces\n-  Dynamic Classes\n-  Iterators and Generators\n-  Functions\n-  Exceptions\n-  Standard Library\n\nRequirements\n\nBring a laptop computer with Python 2.6 or 3.1 installed. Try to get as\nmuch of an overview of Python before the tutorial as you have time to in\norder to get more out of the tutorial. Two angles on this are the Python\nQuick Reference and the Python website's tutorial.\n",
