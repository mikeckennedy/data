  "description": "Python is huge in finance, from banks to hedge-funds to day-traders; it is often the go-to tool to get things done. This talk dives into 'why?'. First looking at several areas where Python is big, what kind of work is involved, and the challenges for developers? Then at what libraries/language aspects make Python particularly suited. Pandas gets particular attention as it is incredibly useful and can make you super productive. We finish up with a demo of how you can use Monte Carlo techniques to build a mini stock market simulation and test out your own trading ideas. After the talk, you should have a better feel for what it's like working with Python in finance and also a good set of starting point if you want to start experimenting.",
