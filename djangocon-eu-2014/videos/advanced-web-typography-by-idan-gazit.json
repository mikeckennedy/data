  "description": "Oliver Reichenstein famously quipped that \u201cThe Web is 95% Typography.\u201d\nMost of the information we take in on the web is textual in nature. It\nbehooves us, as writers and curators of text, to know about the art and\nscience of presenting textual information.\n\nThis talk isn\u2019t about art, or science, but technique. Typesetting has a\nrich history, dating back to Mr. Gutenberg and his printing press.\nAlthough digital type is fairly mature by now, type on the web is still\nvery much in its infancy. We are only now gaining typographical controls\nthat the publishing industry has taken for granted these last 20 years.\nI'll be taking you on tour of the current state of type on the web: what\nwe can do today, and what we will be able to do tomorrow.\n\nSome highlights: \\_ A reintroduction to font-face and the nitty-gritty\ndetails of how it works \\_ Advanced typography with CSS3 font-features\n(http://caniuse.com/#feat=font-feature) \\_ Icon fonts, and semantic use\nthereof \\_ JavaScript tools like fittext.js and lettering.js\n",
