    "description": "Speaker:: Helena Schmidt\n\nTrack: General: Python & PyData Friends\nR and Python are two of the most powerful tools for any kind of\r\ndata analysis. But both programming languages have their strengths and\r\nweaknesses. This means it can be necessary to switch from one to the\r\nother.\r\nWhen is it a good idea to rewrite your R code in Python?\r\nAnd what are good tools to do that successfully?\r\nWhat pitfalls are there?\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/ZEA9NJ\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
