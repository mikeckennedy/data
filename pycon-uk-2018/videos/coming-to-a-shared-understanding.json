  "description": "Or, how I learned to stop assuming and love communication\n\nWhenever multiple people are working on the same thing, there is a need\nto communicate. But how can you be sure that the thing that you're\nthinking about is the same thing that everyone is is thinking about? Are\nyou sure that your idea of a web page with a simple form on it is the\nsame as your colleague's idea of a web page with a simple form on it?\n\nYour team needs a shared understanding, and this talk aims to explore\nwhat that means, why it's important, and equip attendees with some tools\nto help them reach it.",
