  "description": "Python provides a powerful platform for working with data, but often the most straightforward data analysis can be painfully slow. When used effectively, though, Python can be as fast as even compiled languages like C. This talk presents an overview of how to effectively approach optimization of numerical code in Python, touching on tools like numpy, pandas, scipy, cython, numba, and more.",
