  "description": "Natural language processing (NLP) has experienced a rapid growth over\nthe last few years and has become an important skill to build\napplications that range from social features to clinical and health\nsolutions. In this tutorial, we will introduce PyTorch as a tool to\nbuild and experiment with various modern NLP techniques by building deep\nlearning architectures based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs), and bidirectional long short-term\nmemory networks (biLSTMs).\n\nWe will cover a wide range of topics with the purpose of providing\nparticipants with enough fundamental knowledge and skills to be able to\napply modern NLP to real-world problems using PyTorch. Some concepts and\ntopics include but not limited to data loaders, vectorization,\ncomputation graphs, sentiment analysis, fine-grained emotion\nclassification, and neural machine translation.\n\nNowadays, it is just not enough to arbitrarily train a model and deploy\nit for production use without properly debugging it. This tutorial also\naims to provide hands-on examples and well-organized exercises that\nteach students how to properly test, train and evaluate NLP models using\nbest practices. Once models are properly trained and evaluated they will\nbe efficiently transformed, stored, and then restored to obtain\ninferences from real-world, natural language data.\n",
