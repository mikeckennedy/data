  "description": "Energy consumption is an important topic for many. Reducing carbon emissions, saving money on the power bill, and reducing waste are ideas that sound good. But how to go about it?\n\nHome energy monitoring is achievable with a minimal investment in hardware. In fact, hobbyists in our own back yard are running crowdfunding campaigns for it. I got my hands on one and decided to take a look at the insides.\n\nInside was a small ARM microcontroller, and some electronics for measuring the power. The reference firmware, freely available on Github, was written in the Arduino world. My talk describes the challenges, benefits and pitfalls of starting from scratch with MicroPython. You will leave with an understanding of how to use MicroPython for your next Internet of Things project.",
