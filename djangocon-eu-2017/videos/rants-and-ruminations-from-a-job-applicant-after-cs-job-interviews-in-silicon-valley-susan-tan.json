  "description": "What is it like to interview at 1 technology company? Stressful and tiring. What is it like to interview at 100 technology companies total in 4 months? I have done that. In August 2016, I quit a full-time software job to do job searching full-time. I did a job search where I talked to ~100 technology companies in the Bay Area to find the best fit. The hiring process reflects the company culture and its values. Listen to my rants and ruminations from going through various interviewing processes from tiny seed-stage startups to large technology companies in Silicon Valley. Hiring is still broken. Only a few companies do this well. Learn how to reform your own hiring process to be more considerate and thoughtful.",
