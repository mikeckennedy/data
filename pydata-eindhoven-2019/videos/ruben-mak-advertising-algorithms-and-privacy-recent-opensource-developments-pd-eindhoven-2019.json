  "description": "Now more than ever, the trade-off between privacy and the benefits of\noptimally training your algorithms is under heavy discussion. Luckily,\ncompanies (mainly Google), heavily invest in research in this field\nwhich resulted in open sourcing various libraries. In this talk we will\ngo into the technical details or differential privacy, federated\nlearning in Tensorflow and Multi-Party Compute.\n\nThe digital advertising industry has been a great driving factor in the\nrecent developments in data science and AI. However, now more than ever,\nthe trade- off between privacy and the benefits of optimally training\nyour algorithms is under heavy discussion. Luckily, companies (mainly\nGoogle), heavily invest in research in this field which resulted in open\nsourcing various libraries.\n\nAfter a brief introduction about the context privacy in online\nadvertising, we'll dive into the technical details of:\n\n-Differential privacy -Federated learning in Tensorflow -Multi-Party\nCompute -Chromium's Privacy Sandbox -My own vision around Private and\nPublic layers present in a blog from 2018\n",
