  "description": "This talk is base on how to use python and flask to replace paper\ncapturing type of the **downtimes** on a production line.Downtime refers\nto the time where the machine is stopped for a particular period/time\nwhile it is suppose to run eg breakdown.This project used python, flask\nand a mysql database and it was a web application.It was done as a case\nstudy for Unilever Zimbabwe (pvt) ltd.The project was done on two\nwashing powder production lines. It was all about capturing and storing\ntime losses and the specific type of the time loss in real time. I did\nthis as my first python project so it it presents how you can come up\nwith an idea from a different field and solve it using python.\n\nTarget audience will be mainly industrial engineers and beginners.It\nalso showcase the use of software in production factories.This can also\nhelp students and learners on how creative they can become while doing a\nproject either as an individual task or as an educational\nrequirement.This talk will showcase how you can implement python in an\nenviroment where it is not known or used.\n",
