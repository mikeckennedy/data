  "description": "In the past few years we have seen a lot of advances regarding the\nhardware python can run on.\n\nYou're probably used to Python running on \"regular\" computers. But 10\nyears ago a revolution started with the Raspberry Pi that was one of the\nfirst computers in decades, thanks to its GPIO headers, which allowed\neasy control of electronic hardware from a programming language.\n\nThat was the dawn of a new era that opened-up electronic hardware\nprogramming with python on multiple devices as micro-controllers like\nthe BBC Micro:bit thanks to MicroPyton and plenty of other MCU's running\neither MicroPython or CircuitPython (a friendly fork of MicroPython).\n\nBut it doesn't stop there, Python can also run on phones and tablets\nthanks to BeeWare and Kivy.\n",
