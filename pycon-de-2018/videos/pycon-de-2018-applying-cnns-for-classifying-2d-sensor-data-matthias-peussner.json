  "description": "When being the first in your company to apply a deep learning algorithm\non your data you often have to overcome several obstacles. One challenge\nis to understand your data and to form a training and test dataset.\nAnother one is to get your algorithms and its performance accepted and\nintegrated in your existing processing workflow.\n\nConvolutional Neural Networks have become a standard tool in processing\nimage data. They have shown to reach human-level classification\nperformance on some object recognition tasks.\n\nIn this talk I will present my experiences in getting started using a\nconvolutional neural network for classification of 2D sensor data. I\nwill point out the importance of understanding your data and give hints\nof how to select your train and test datasets according to the\nrequirements. Furthermore, I will show how to get a feature extractor\nout of the classifier and how to visualize it.\n",
