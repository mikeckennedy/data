  "description": "\"Keynote: Async, Python, and the Future\" by: Andrew Godwin\nIt's been over five years since \"await\" made it into Python, and much longer still since the first async frameworks brought us their mysterious power to serve multiple web requests at once. But where are we now? What inroads have we made?\nJoin us as we take a look at the current state of the Python libraries, frameworks and projects dealing with async; some thoughts on lessons we can learn from the process; and a look forward at upcoming projects, ideas and potential ways we can change, adapt, and embrace async as a part of Python web programming.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
