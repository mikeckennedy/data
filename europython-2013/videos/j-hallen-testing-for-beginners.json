  "description": "Writing automated tests for your code is a requirement in modern\nsoftware development and there lots of tools for collecting and running\ntests. There are also lots of instructions for how to use the tools.\n\nHowever, there are very few places where you can find out how to write\nyour code so that it is testable and how to write meaningful tests.\n\nThis talk will focus on best practices for writing tests and you should\ncome away from it with a better understanding of what kinds of test to\nwrite, when to write them and how to think about testing problems.\n\nThe talk is designed for beginner coders and people who have recently\nstarted to learn Python. We will be using the Python unittest framework\nand py.test in the examples.\n",
