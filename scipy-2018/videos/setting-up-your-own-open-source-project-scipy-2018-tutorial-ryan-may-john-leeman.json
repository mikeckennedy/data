  "description": "Setting up an open source project with an advanced set of tools is\neasier than ever. However, the breadth and complexity of the tools\navailable can be intimidating to the new user. In this half-day,\nintermediate level tutorial, we will interactively walk through the\nsteps needed to set up an open source project on GitHub in the most\nsustainable fashion possible. Topics discussed and covered in a hands-on\nfashion include: creating a new repository on GitHub; testing with\nPyTest; continuous integration with TravisCI; and online documentation\nwith Sphinx and ReadTheDocs. The goal of the tutorial is to get\nattendees over the initial hump of learning these tools and communicate\nsome best practices from the world of open source.Presenter(s): Speaker:\nRyan May, UCAR/Unidata Speaker: John Leeman, UCAR/Unidata\n",
