  "description": "In this tutorial, we will introduce Python as a spatial problem solving and data visualization tool. To demonstrate the power of Python for spatial analysis, we will solve a spatial problem and make a beautiful map of our results. Along the way, we will discuss considerations when dealing with spatial data and the wide range of Python tools available for spatial analysis.",
