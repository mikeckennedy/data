  "description": "zc.buildout is a tool to install and configure applications. An\napplication may consist of multiple parts and include multiple programs\nand processes. Both installation and configuration of the application as\na whole are controlled by a configuration file which makes it possible\nto reproduce them exactly at a later point in time or on a different\nhost. zc.buildout is extensible so it may be used to install application\nparts with nearly arbitrary individual requirements. The talk introduces\nzc.buildout, gives an overview of its possibilities as well as the major\nthird-party extensions and demonstrates the system by means of a case\nstudy.\n",
