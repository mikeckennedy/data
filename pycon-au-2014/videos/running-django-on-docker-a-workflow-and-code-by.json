  "description": "Docker (http://docker.io) is the hot-new-thing out there for running\nyour application in development and in production. Here at Infoxchange,\nwe are extremely excited about how Docker allows a build-once,\nrun-anywhere approach to moving applications from testing through to\nproduction. We are one of the first organisations to be using Docker in\nproduction on high-SLA applications.\n\nIn this talk we will present:\n\n-  a quick intro to Docker and how it solves our problems at\n   Infoxchange;\n-  our interface for hosting applications on Docker (\"pallet\");\n-  how to build and develop a Python app on Docker;\n-  Infoxchange's Django settings module for the pallet interface;\n-  Forklift (https://github.com/infoxchange/docker-forklift), a tool\n   we've developed for running and developing apps that use the pallet\n   interface, in and out of a Docker container; and\n-  Extending forklift for your services.\n\nIf time permits we will try and cover the additional bonus topics:\n\n-  How to host your legacy mod\\_python application on Apache inside\n   Docker with minimal changes; and\n-  Using Forklift to do automated full-stack integration testing of apps\n   by spinning up containers of other apps (which we do in a container\n   that is testing the built app that is running in a container that is\n   our CI server... inception is possible).\n\nThe talk will be presented by Danielle Madeley and Alexey Kotlyarov.\n",
