  "description": "Modern web-apps require bi-directional communication, reacting not only\nto user actions but also to server events. This can be achieved\nelegantly using Web Sockets, a protocol standardized by W3C to be a\ndefault tool for full- duplex connections on the Web.\n\nAlthough most web-frameworks do not support Web Socket integration out\nof the box, Python has multiple options available making it a piece of\ncake. This talk showcases integrating Web Sockets in Python web-apps,\nfocusing on situations that can make good use of it and presenting\nimplementations with most popular frameworks: Tornado and Django. We\nwill explore a similar style but different underlying technologies of\nboth, and finish with a live demo.\n",
