Typically, analysts use the conversion rate to assess how successful a website is at converting trial users into paying ones. But is this calculation giving us results that are lower than reality? With a talk rich in examples, Tristan will show how Shopify reframes the traditional conversion questions in survival analysis terms.\n\n- To get started we will see examples of how skewed conversion rates can be when analyzing conversions that are delayed.\n\n- Then, we will cover the basics of survival analysis (survival function, hazard function) and the kind of data it requires.\n\n- Using the lifelines python library, we will apply survival analysis to answer the limitations of conversion rates and gain insight about new merchants on Shopify.\n\n- In a second case study, we will code to extend our toolbox outside of lifelines with the analysis of multiple outcomes (competing risks).",
