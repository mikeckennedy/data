  "description": "Everyone starts with the best intentions with their Python projects,\n\"this time it's going to be clean, simple and maintainable\". But code\nevolves over time, requirements change and codebases can get messy and\ncomplicated quickly.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how to use ``wily`` to measure and graph\nhow complicated your Python code is and a series of practical techniques\nto simplify it. ``wily`` will show you which parts of your projects are\nbecoming or have become hard to maintain and need a refactor. Once you\nknow where the skeletons are, you will learn practical techniques for\nrefactoring \"complex\" code and some resources to use to take your\nrefactoring to the next level.\n",
