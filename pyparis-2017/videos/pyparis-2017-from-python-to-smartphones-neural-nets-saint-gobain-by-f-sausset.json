  "description": "We use Keras for fast prototyping neural nets in a variety of\napplications. To put them in the hands of end-users, these models are\nported to smartphones GPUs using Tensorflow. As an example, we built a\ngeneric prototype app able to handle any input tensors, in particular\nfor audio recognition.\n",
