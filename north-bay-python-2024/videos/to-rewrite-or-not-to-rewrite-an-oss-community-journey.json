  "description": "\u201cI love breaking changes!\u201d said no developer, ever. Backwards incompatibility can be disruptive to a community, but sometimes it\u2019s a necessary evil in the long run to move forward.\n\nHaystack is a free open source Python LLM framework. It was launched in 2020, before LLMs were cool. In 2023 we decided to undergo a major re-architecture, culminating in the release of Haystack 2.0. It wasn't an easy decision. By involving the open source community in our design process early on, we are confident we built a more usable, flexible foundation for years to come.\n\nIn this talk you'll learn how we designed abstractions with the right level of flexibility / composability in the rapidly changing LLM landscape. We'll not only show you the new features Haystack 2.0 provides, but we will also give you a peek into our future roadmap. You'll walk away with a better understanding of how modern LLM frameworks can help you solve problems at scale with LLM technologies, as well as an enriched understanding of how to think for the long-term when building for an open source community.\n",
