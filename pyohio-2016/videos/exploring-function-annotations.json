  "description": "Python's function annotations allow you to provide metadata about a function's inputs and outputs. Most often, these annotations are used for type checking or type casting. I'll talk through examples of each, including `typing` from the Python 3.5 standard library and the `mypy` static type checker. This talk expects basic knowledge of Python but no experience with function annotations is needed.",
