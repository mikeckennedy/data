  "description": "Authors: Simon Ratcliffe SKA South Africa, Ludwig Schwardt SKA South\nAfrica\n\nTrack: Astronomy and Astrophysics\n\nThe Square Kilometer Array will be one of the prime scientific data\ngenerates in the next few decades.\n\nConstruction is scheduled to commence in late 2016 and last for the best\npart of a decade. Current estimates put data volume generation near 1\nExabyte per day with 2-3 ExaFLOPs of processing required to handle this\ndata.\n\nAs a host country, South Africa is constructing a large precursor\ntelescope known as MeerKAT. Once complete this will be the most\nsensitive telescope of it's kind in the world - until dwarfed by the\nSKA.\n\nWe make extensive use of Python from the entire Monitor and Control\nsystem through to data handling and processing.\n\nThis talk looks at our current usage of Python, and our desire to see\nthe entire high performance processing chain being able to call itself\nPythonic.\n\nWe will discuss some of the challenges specific to the radio astronomy\nenvironment and how we believe Python can contribute, particularly when\nit comes to the trade off between development time and performance.\n",
