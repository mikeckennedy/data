  "description": "The Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) was introduced at LDAPCon 2011 and has been enjoying tremendous success in the intervening time. LMDB was written for the OpenLDAP Project and has proved to be the world\u2019s smallest, fastest, and most reliable transactional embedded data store. It has cemented OpenLDAP\u2019s position as world\u2019s fastest directory server, and its adoption outside the OpenLDAP Project continues to grow, with a wide range of applications including big data services, crypto-currencies, machine learning, and many others. The talk will cover highlights of the LMDB design as well as the impact of LMDB on other projects. ",
