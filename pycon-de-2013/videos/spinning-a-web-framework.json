  "summary": "Over the years I've been exposed to a lot of ideas in web frameworks.\nReflecting on these ideas is valuable when you build a new one, but also\nwhen you simply use an existing web framework.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss the slow genesis of Morepath, a micro\nweb-framework with super powers that I've created, and discuss some of\nthe ideas behind it, things I've learned, and also share some thoughts\nabout the creative process.\n\nThe ideas behind Morepath are not revolutionary, but hopefully still\nmake you think.\n",
