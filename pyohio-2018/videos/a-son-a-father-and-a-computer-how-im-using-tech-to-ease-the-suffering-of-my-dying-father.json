  "abstract": "Using Python, I built:\n\n-  An Emergency notification system that texts family members.\n-  A \"help button\" where a mother who *never* asks for help can simply\n   push it, and her closest friends will get a reminder to call and\n   encourage her.\n-  A python-powered, Voice-activated IR system to turn on music, tv, and\n   more. Engaged with custom wake words, and powered by a Raspberry Pi.\n-  A music player that will allow my dad to listen to his favorite music\n   when he's feeling down, without having to push a single button.\n",
  "description": "My father is dying. He has ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), of which\nthere is no cure. Feeling powerless in the face of disease, I set out to\ndo what I could: Build tech to ease his suffering, to help him feel more\nconnected with his loved ones, and to share what I'm building for free.\nThis is my story.\n",
