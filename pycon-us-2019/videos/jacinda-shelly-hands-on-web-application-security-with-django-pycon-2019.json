  "description": "XSS, SQL Injections and Improper Authorization, oh my! Between the OWASP\nTop 10, CSRF, stealing sessions, and DDOS attacks, have you ever felt\nthat the world of web security was too complex to understand? Do you\nfind yourself wishing that you understood what those acronyms *really*\ntranslate to in a live web application?\n\nIf so, then this is the tutorial you've been waiting for. In this\ntutorial, we'll cover essential topics in web security, including the\nmajority of the OWASP Top 10, but we *won't* be doing it in a\ntheoretical manner. We'll take a live, deliberately insecure web\napplication, identify the vulnerabilities, exploit them, and finally fix\nthem. Sound cool? It is!\n\nTopics include the following:\n\n-  Cross-site scripting (XSS)\n-  Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)\n-  Cookies and how they can be abused\n-  Why default passwords are dangerous\n-  Improper authorization checking\n-  Incorrect Session Management\n-  SQL Injection\n-  How to abuse Pickle\n-  And more!\n\nYou'll also learn next steps and we'll provide suggested resources for\ncontinuing your security education.\n\nWhile previous experience with Django is not required, it is\nrecommended. You should have an understanding of how web applications\nwork in general and have completed the official `Django\nTutorial <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/>`__ or\nsomething substantially similar.\n",
