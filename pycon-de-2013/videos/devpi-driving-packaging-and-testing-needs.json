  "summary": "devpi provides both a private pypi server, a self-updating\npypi.python.org package cache, and work flow commands for uploading,\ntesting and installing packages. This talk shows some example scenarios\nand discusses the unique feature of seemlessly \"inheriting\" the\npypi.python.org packages into your private index. We'll also look into\nhow you can perform testing of a package before you push a release to\nthe public index or your company-specific private index.\n",
