  "abstract": "Engineers and researchers come in all shapes and colours, but we tend to\nhave one thing in common: an eagerness to see nails for our new hammers\neverywhere. This talk discusses practical steps that can help you\ncharacterize your problem and decide whether to adopt a traditional\nComputer Vision approach or invest in a Deep Learning solution. It will\nthen discuss tools, metrics and good practices in the implementation to\nvalidate reliably, even across very different technologies.\n\nThe talk is geared towards practitioners who start from a problem and\nwonder about the *how*. However, it can be useful to researchers and\nstudents who start from a technique they are studying and want some\nadditional tools and engineering tricks to do so systematically.\n\nIt will assume some some familiarity with software development and with\nMachine Learning, Computer Vision and/or Deep Learning.\n",

  "description": "We're in a transitional time where it is not always clear whether (Deep)\nNeural Networks are the best way to solve a given problem - even in\nComputer Vision. This talk discusses practical steps, tools and\npractices that can help you make that decision and follow through.\n",
