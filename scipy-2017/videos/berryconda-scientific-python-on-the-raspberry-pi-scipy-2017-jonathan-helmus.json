  "description": "The Raspberry Pi is a series of low cost single-board computers widely used for teaching computer science and popular with the robotics community. Although Python has been a target programming language on the Pi, the selection of scientific Python packages available in the default Raspbian operating system is often limited. Many of the popular newer libraries are missing, and only older versions of many of the core packages are available. Users wanting a wider and more up-to-date selection of packages are left to compile the software themselves or to use an alternative operating system.     The berryconda project aims to address these limitations. Berryconda is a conda based Python distribution for the Raspberry Pi. With it, you can install and manage a scientific python stack on your Raspberry Pi using conda, an open-source package and environment management system.",
