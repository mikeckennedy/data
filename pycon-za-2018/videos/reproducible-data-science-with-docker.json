  "description": "Collaboration is a major part of doing Data Science. This means Data\nScientists are always sharing their work with their colleagues whether\nto continue in the Data Science process or for review. One problem that\nis mostly faced in this process is the \"It works on my machine\" problem.\n\nDocker is a tool that is used to package and run applications with all\ntheir dependencies in an isolated environment.\n\nIn this talk, I'll use Python to analyse some data in jupyter notebooks\nand show how Docker can be used to ensure reproducibility of that\nanalysis in a different environment.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\n-  The basics of the data science workflow\n-  The basics of Docker\n-  A demonstration of sharing and reproducing data analysis work in a\n   jupyter notebook.\n",
