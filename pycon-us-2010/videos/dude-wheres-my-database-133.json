  "description": "Dude, Where's My Database?\n\nPresented by Eric Florenzano (Django)\n\nThere are so many great open source databases out on the market right\nnow-- we're really in the golden age of databases. Fortunately, Python\ncan talk to virtually all of them. With so many databases at our\ndisposal, how do we choose which one to use for our particular use case?\n\nThis talk will go over the many different classes of databases,\nintroduce some of the particular implementations for each class of\ndatabase, and describe the strengths and weaknesses of each. By weighing\nthe pros and cons of each type of database, the speaker hopes to dispel\nthe many rumors and misconceptions that people have about what's out\nthere today.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Audio cuts out at about 20 seconds in, then gets out\nof sync until around 3:10.]\n",
