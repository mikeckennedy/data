  "description": "Stripe's system for preventing fraudulent payments utilizes a mix of\nmachine learning and data analysis. Over the last few years, it has\nevolved from a collection of manually assembled ad-hoc rules to an\nensemble of machine- learned models based on historical data from across\nthe entire Stripe network. This talk will describe some of the technical\nchallenges we've faced in building and scaling it. In particular I will\ndiscuss how we've used (and occasionally written) various Python\npackages as part of a broader ecosystem to address data processing,\nfeature engineering, and model evaluation problems.\n\nSome examples:\n\n-  We use scikit-learn to train a majority of our models\n-  We use luigi to manage long-running feature generation jobs and model\n   training scripts\n-  We use pandas to debug models and features that generate systematic\n   false positives\n-  We wrote topmodel to evaluate model performance on both production\n   and backtested data\n",
