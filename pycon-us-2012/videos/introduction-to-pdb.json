  "summary": "PDB is an interactive debugging environment for Python programs. It\nallows you to pause your program, look at the values of variables, and\nwatch program execution step-by-step, so you can understand what your\nprogram is actually doing, as opposed to what you think it's doing. This\ntalk will show novice and intermediate Python users how to use PDB to\ntroubleshoot existing code.\n",
