  "description": "Speaker: Charles Merriam\n\n\"Python\" encompasses a huge knowledge area of internals, libraries, tools, and philosophy. This talk maps the knowledge touching on the Zen of Python, decorators, dunders, Django, Jupyter and more. You will learn something new and map how Python fits together as a coherent whole.\n\nCharles Merriam has presented to BayPiggies and PyCon many times over the years, including a 2007 talk on this same subject.\n\nEditor's note: this talk is really great. If you are a beginner, you will learn a lot about how to wrap your head around the Python language and ecosystem. If you are an experienced Python developer, the talk will leave you with renewed enthusiasm for Python.",
