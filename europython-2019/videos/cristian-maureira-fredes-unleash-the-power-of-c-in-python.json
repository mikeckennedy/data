  "description": "| One of the main Python aspects is to have a clear syntax and be an\n| easy-to-understand language, which compared to others like C++\n| (depending of the kindness of the developer) can make a huge\n  difference.\n| Not only the readability is in play, having a dynamically typed\n| and interpreted language improves the development workflow.\n\n| This improvement comes with a cost, performance.\n| In most of the cases, a raw comparison of simple routines will leave\n| Python behind, but there is a partial solution to this problem,\n  connecting\n| a powerful performant C++ library with the simplicity of Python.\n\n| In this talk, we will go through the process of generating language\n  bindings\n| to allow you to take any amazing C or C++ project and bring it to\n  Python\n| land. We will briefly discuss one of the many success stories, and we\n  will\n| analyze how the Qt project managed to expose its whole framework to\n  Python,\n| with the help of a self-made binding generator called Shiboken.\n\n| After the talk, you will be able to decide which option is better for\n  the\n| projects you have in mind, and with a bit of luck you will be\n  responsible\n| of exposing the next popular C++ library that makes the life of us all\n  Pythonistas easier.",
