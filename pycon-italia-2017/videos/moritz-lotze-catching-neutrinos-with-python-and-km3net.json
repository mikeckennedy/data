  "description": "KM3NeT is the next generation underwater neutrino telescope located in\nthe deepest seas of the Mediterranean. Once completed, it will have an\ninstrumented volume of several cubic kilometres. One of the technical\nchallenges in such a huge project is providing software tools, which can\nbe rapidly developed and maintained while keeping a focus on\nportability, compatibility and usability. The area of application ranges\nfrom live monitoring over offline processing and analysis to data\nvisualisation and 3D event displays. Python with it\u2019s wonderful standard\nlibrary combined with extraordinary open source frameworks proves to be\nable to handle all these different tasks with ease. This talk covers\nsome of the projects used in our collaboration to make our lives easier,\nfeaturing technologies such as Cython, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib,\nJupyter, Tornado, PyOpenGL, urwid and more, and focusses on one of our\nkey ingredients: a framework called KM3Pipe, which provides a\npipeline-based workflow to allow us building complex analysis chains by\nstitching together modules.\n",
