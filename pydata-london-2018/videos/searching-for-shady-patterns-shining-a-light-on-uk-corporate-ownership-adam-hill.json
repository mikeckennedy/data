  "abstract": "In June 2016 the UK government launched the world\u2019s first \u201cbeneficial\nownership\u201d register; a requirement for all UK companies to register who\nwere the \u201cpersons of significant control\u201d, PSCs, who actually controlled\nthe company. Recent investigative journalism has made headlines with the\nleaking of the Panama and Paradise papers and it is clear that\ntransparency in corporate ownership needs to be a significant factor\nwithin modern democracy. In a partnership between DataKind UK and Global\nWitness we have built the worlds first network graph mapping all of the\nUK public data on those who control corporate interests in the UK; it\ncomprises in excess of 4.5 million companies and 4 million individual\npeople. It has been enriched with company officer data and metrics of\nfinancial secrecy based upon geographic regions.\n\nThe goal of the project was to enable Global Witness to search for\n\"shady patterns\" within corporate ownership networks to act as leads for\ninvestigative journalism to expose corrupt practices. Further more, we\nwere able to analyse the completeness of the register and identify ways\nof improving such data structures to inform other world governments how\nto best build similar public registers of corporate ownership.\n\nWe present here how we built this amazing data structure using Python\ntools for cleaning and data processing and a Neo4j graph database\nstoring the network graph itself. In addition, we share the first\ninsights derived from this process.\n",
