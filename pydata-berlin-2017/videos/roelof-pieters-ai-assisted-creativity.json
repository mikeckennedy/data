Recent advances in Deep Learning, especially generative models, make it possible to generate text, audio, speech, and images. There's a wonderfully trippy world of neural nets \"going wild\" out there, with AI choreographed dancing moves, freestyle raps, impressionist paintings, and Trump impersonating bots. Such \"bots\" and experiments are but one novel use of this kind of \"Creative AI\". Taking a more human-centered approach, allowing for control and agency, has the potential to turn these content-generating neural nets, into tools for creative use and explorations of human-machine interaction, where the main theorem is \"augmentation, not automation\". The talk will particularly focus on \"generative\" models, and show the python fanatic how to make your move with these particular forms of Deep Neural Nets.\n\n",
