  "description": "Programming languages evolves with the need to the developers, but not\nall of them evolves at the same speed and sometimes some languages stays\nalmost the same for decades. Is this a sign of stagnation? Is it\npossible to evolve a language without breaking retrocompatibility?\n\nThis talk will cover how Python and Javascript approached the problem in\na radically different way, with their pro and cons and with the\nconsequences on the community.\n\nThe main points of this talk are:\n\n-  comparation of the new features in both languages\n-  strategies used to port or run the code on different versions of the\n   language\n-  impact of the new features and tool on the respective developer\u2019s\n   communities\n\nThe intent is to start a constructive discussion about the\nretrocompatility in Python.\n\nFor this talk you don\u2019t need to have a deep knowledge of Python or\nJavascript.\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 20 April** at 11:45 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
