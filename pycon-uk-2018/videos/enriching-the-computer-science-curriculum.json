  "description": "How to take advantage of enrichment initiatives and innovative classroom environments to enrich the computing curriculum\n\nDespite the government's best efforts, students are being turned off\nwhen it comes to engaging with computer science. The number of students\nopting for the new Computer Science GCSE and A-Levels is lower than\nprevious figures for ICT. In addition, the gender gap has widened.\n\nAs of 2017, 54% of UK schools were not even offering Computer Science as\na GCSE option. With motivation for the subject low, student numbers\ndeclining and the digital skills gap increasing, a solution must be\nfound to enthuse students and increase engagement with computing.\n\nI'll be introducing teachers to initiatives including after-school\nclubs, creative classroom projects and classroom displays that inspire\nand get students talking about the amazing and exciting side of\ncomputing to re-enter inspire and engage them with the subject we love.",
