  "description": "Learn about Intel\u00ae Deep Learning Boost, also known as Vector Neural\nNetwork Instructions (VNNI), a new set of AVX-512 instructions, that are\ndesigned to deliver significantly more efficient Deep Learning\n(Inference) acceleration. Through this technology, I will show you how\nyou can perform low-precision (INT8) inference much faster on hardware\nthat support the VNNI instruction set (for example, the 2nd generation\nIntel Xeon Scalable processors, codenamed, Cascade Lake). In the live\nJupyter notebook session, you can will be able to see the benefits of\nthis new hardware technology.\n\nNote: This is an advanced talk. Knowledge about Deep Learning,\nInferencing and basic awareness of hardware instruction sets would be\ndesirable.",
