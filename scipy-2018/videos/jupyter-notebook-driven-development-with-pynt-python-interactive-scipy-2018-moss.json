  "description": "In this talk, I will present pynt (*py*\\ thon i\\ *nt*\\ eractive), a tool\nwhich leverages the interactive capabilities of Jupyter Notebooks to\nprovide a rich programming environment conducive to the later stages of\nsoftware development. I will begin by discussing common workflow in\nsoftware development, as well their limitations. I will then motivate\nthe merits of pynt by demonstrating how adopting a\nJupyter-Notebook-Driven-Development workflow can overcome some of these\nlimitations, and then how pynt streamlines this workflow. I will end\nwith a feature-tour of pynt and the different approach to software\ndevelopment workflow that pynt encourages.Presenter(s): Speaker: Edward\nBanner, mosss.com\n",
