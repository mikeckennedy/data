  "description": "Web2py is a web framework for rapid development of secure database\ndriven web applications. It was originally created to address very\nspecific teaching needs and went mainstream, now counting thousands of\nusers both in the academic and in the business worlds. Web2py has been\nused for teaching University level web development courses in the United\nStates, South America and Europe, for research projects of public\nutility, and for many business applications. In this talk we discuss the\nmotivations behind web2py, why we think it is important to make web\ndevelopment easy, where we are and where we should be.\n",
