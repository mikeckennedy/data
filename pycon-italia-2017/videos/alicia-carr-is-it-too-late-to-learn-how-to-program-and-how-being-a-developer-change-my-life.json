  "description": "How I became a developer in my 50th. the challenges, the assumption and\nthe victories and how women are not being recognized as an important\npart of the tech community.\n\nHow and why I wanted to be an iOS mobile developer at the age of 51.\nSome people want to believe that people my age are out of touch with\ntechnology and as a woman, I have seen the best and the worst in the\ntech community but I also now that there is a solution at the end of the\nrainbow.\n\nWith the boom in use of smartphones, we have seen a corresponding growth\nin numbers of available apps, some of which are being leveraged for\nsocial change. What people don\u2019t know is 70% of women are more active on\nour mobile device than men, women are more active with social media,\nshopping, photo apps, are more connected to entertainers and play more\ngames on their smartphones.\n\nWith that being said we the tech community need to open up our arm and\nembrace the change and think about how women in tech can change the way\nwe see and create apps.\n",
