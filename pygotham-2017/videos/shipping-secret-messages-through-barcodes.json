  "description": "Barcodes are used every day to keep track of the most important things in our lives and our businesses. We use them to track packages, to count inventory, and even to encode secret information! How these encodings work are very rarely discussed and there are even fewer libraries to help create them using Python.\n\nShipping labels are typically generated through a specific language which can initially seem confusing and unapproachable. I will walk you through how I've used Python to lower that barrier to entry. The width and frequency of the bars will start to seem less arbitrary and you'll learn how to interpret the secret encoded information.",
