  "description": "Day 2, 14:30\u201315:00\n\nFor the last year, I have been interning at CyCraft AI Lab, the leading cybersecurity firm in Taiwan. My team had to process numerous cybersecurity articles and turn them to actionable information. Due to time pressure to respond to cyber attacks, we constructed a NLP system to tackle this problem.\nIn the project, I construct the whole data processing pipeline to turn the articles into intelligence\n1.Crawling the largest Chinese security website\n2. Classifying articles to help security team quickly identify articles related to their daily missions.\n3. Setting up the recommendation system of prevalent attack methods to help security analyst quickly realize the articles\u2019 theme.\n4.Recognizing attack technique in articles and labeling with MITRE ATT&CK technique\nOur system has achieved 95% accuracy on our collected dataset. I will share our solutions to problems we met during the process and how I balance between intern and high school life.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wk8Hzw6fvqDemKvF2TO2W5Ot04I9iQ_giaIgShnmV9k/edit?usp=sharing\n\nSpeaker: Chia-En Tsai\n\nTaipei First Girls Highschool Student\nArtificial Intelligence club President\nIntern in CyCraft AI Lab",
