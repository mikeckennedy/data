Hoping it can bring some delights to people who ever used Python to call the web API, whatever kind that API is.\n\nI will brief my experience of writing Python from raw API, REST API, to current GraphQL API. **3** generations of iCHEF GraphQL will be demonstrated to pave the road of followers.\n\nIt should bring more understanding of GraphQL interaction between web frontend, backend, and mobile clients, more examples of API design & usage, and details of GraphQL schema implement in Graphene & Django.\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\n\nSpeaker: Keith Yang\n\n\u6700\u8fd1\u89ba\u5f97\u908a\u9a0e\u5ba4\u5167\u8173\u8e0f\u8eca\u908a\u7528\u96fb\u8166\uff0c\u96e2\u958b\u81c9\u66f8\u8207 IG \u7684\u7cbe\u795e\uff08\u795e\u7d93\uff1f\uff09\u751f\u6d3b\u5f88\u4e0d\u8cf4\u3002\u8b93\u9019\u96bb\u5c0f\u767d\u9f20\u5f9e\u5927\u773e\u5fc3\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u5be6\u9a57\u5b78\u88e1\u5598\u4e86\u4e00\u5c0f\u53e3\u6c23\u3002\n\nRecently he enjoys skateboard commute, still coffee-achemy, and indoor cycle while programming or gaming, an awesome mind vocation of leaving FB and IG.\n\nKeith is the founder and co-organizer of Taipei.py, largest Python user group in Taiwan, a Lead Software Engineer at iCHEF, and was Chairperson of PyCon APAC 2015. His work mostly focuses on web/backend/cloud services since 2006, and he hands on kernel tools of virtualization on hypervisors in 2016.",
