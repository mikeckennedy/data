  "description": "There is a new alternative to REST API. GraphQL. GraphQL has been created by Facebook in 2012 and since then is being used by big companies like Facebook itself, Github, Shopify and so on. In this talk I'd like to explain why we need an alternative to REST APIs and why GraphQL is that alternative. Also we will see how to use GraphQL with Django and how to use it for non trivial applications.",
