  "description": "Language modelling is a hard task in Natural Language Processing. Each\nlanguage has so many nuances to it and we've barely scratched the\nsurface in trying to understand how we came about learning them. In the\ntalk, I'll be briefly discussing the importance of language in our\nsociety, how it helps us become a sort of a hive mind to learn from each\nother. I'll show the progress we've made in text generation and the\nvarious techniques that have proven to be successful so far (bow,\nembeddings, language models). Lastly, I'll be showing some recent\nadvances in unsupervised transfer learning in NLP (ULMFiT, ELMo) with a\npractical implementation of a pretrained model learning to write like\nShakespeare using his texts. Will end the talk with possible areas to\nexplore in the field. The code will be in the form of a Jupyter\nnotebook.\n",
