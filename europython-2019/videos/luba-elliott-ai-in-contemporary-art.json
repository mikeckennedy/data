  "description": "Over the past couple of years, there has been increasing interest in\napplying the latest advances in machine learning to creative projects in\nart and design. From DeepDream and style transfer to a GAN-generated\npainting selling for $430,000 at auction, AI art has moved beyond the\nworld of research and academia and become a trend in its own right.\nMeanwhile, the contemporary art world's fascination with the social\nimpact of facial recognition, recommendation systems and deep fakes has\nencouraged artists to explore AI critically as subject matter. This talk\nwill give an overview of how artists and technologists are using and\nthinking about machine learning, its creative potential and societal\nimpact.",
