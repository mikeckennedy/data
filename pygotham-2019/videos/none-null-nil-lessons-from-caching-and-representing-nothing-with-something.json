  "description": "Phil Karlton once said, `There are only two hard things in Computer Science:\ncache invalidation and naming things`.\n\nThis talk is about the value of `nothing`. I will discuss the success of\nbuilding a cache for app performance, but how at one point `nothing` took\ndown production. You will learn factors to consider when caching for APIs\nincluding cache storage, api design, cache invalidation, and serialization\n(of null values).",
