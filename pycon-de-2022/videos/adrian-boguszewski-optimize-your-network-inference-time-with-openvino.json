    "description": "Speaker:: Adrian Boguszewski\n\nTrack: PyData: Deep Learning\nDuring the talk, I'll present the OpenVINO\u2122 Toolkit. You'll learn how to automatically convert the model using Model Optimizer and how to run the inference with OpenVINO Runtime to infer your model with low latency on the CPU and iGPU you already have. The magic with only a few lines of code.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/PKERX8\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
