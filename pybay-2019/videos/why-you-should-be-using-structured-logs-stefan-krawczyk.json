For example, data scientists can add a field to their application log and it will automatically turn up as a parsed field in Elasticsearch for easy dashboarding and querying via Kibana, or be easily found and queried in Presto. In this talk we\u2019ll cover in more detail why structured logs are useful and provide leverage, caveats to using them, and how simple it is to get one going with Python.\n\nAbout the speaker\nStefan loves the stimulus of working at the intersection of design, engineering, and data. He grew up in New Zealand, speaks Polish, and spent formative years at Stanford, LinkedIn, Nextdoor & Idibon. Outside of work Stefan likes to \ud83c\udfca, \ud83c\udf2e, \ud83c\udf7a, and \u2708.\n\nSponsor Acknowledgement\nThis and other PyBay2019 videos are via the help of our media partner AlphaVoice (https://www.alphavoice.io/)!\n\n#pybay #pybay2019 #python #python3 #gdb",
