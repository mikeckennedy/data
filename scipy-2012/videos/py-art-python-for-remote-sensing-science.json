  "description": "The drive to publish often leaves scientists working with old,\ninflexible, poorly documented dead end software. Even operational\nsystems can end up being a mash of legacy systems cobbled together. As\nthe Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Facility brings its\n30+ cloud and precipitation sensitive radars into operation a concerted\neffort to modernize, modularize and adapt existing code and write new\ncode to retrieve geophysical parameters from the remotely sensed\nsignals. Due to the open nature, active development community and lack\nof licensing issues Python is a natural development environment choice.\nThis presentation will outline the challenges involved in retrieving\nmodel comparable geophysical parameters from scanning weather radars,\nintroduce the framework behind the Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) and\ndiscuss the challenges involved in building high performance code while\nmaintaining portability, readability and ease of use.\n",
