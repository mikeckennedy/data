  "description": "Radio waves are all around us, yet they are usually inaccessible from typical software applications. Recent years have seen an explosion of software-defined radio (SDR) applications, mainly due to the availability of cheap ($10) USB radio dongles. SDR can be utilized not only to listen to FM radio, but also to track airplanes in the sky, interact with wireless consumer electronics, and even receive satellite imagery. This interactive and fast-paced talk will provide a glimpse into the vast world of SDR, and show which tools in the Python ecosystem are available for building radio-aware applications.",
