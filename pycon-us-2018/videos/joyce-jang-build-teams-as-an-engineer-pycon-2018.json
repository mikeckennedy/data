  "description": "We build product and software as teams. And as anyone who as worked on a team knows, there\u2019s often a lot more that goes into working together to build that product than actually just building the product itself. A highly functional team is not as elusive it may seem. Software engineering is a skill we\u2019ve developed, but even more importantly software engineering on teams is another skill we\u2019ve been practicing and improving on as an industry. Software engineering principles and best practices may seem to have very little to do with teamwork, but being able to thoughtfully apply some of what we\u2019ve learned as engineers towards teamwork, we can help move towards creating such success with our teams.",
