  "description": "Fight fake news with cryptography & human nature\n\nJust as journalism has taken a critical financial hit, fake news is\nmultiplying across social networks faster than facts. The public doesn't\nknow which stories are real any more because anyone with a laptop can\nforge audio & video in record time. We need to empower the institutions\nwe trust with the ability to tie their reputations to the journalism\nthey produce.\n\nAletheia uses cryptographic signatures + DNS to leverage existing\nnetworks of human trust in individual journalists & institutions to help\nlink those people to the work they produce with a view to change our\nexpectations of what constitutes journalism: if it's not verified, it's\njust some stranger on the internet.",
