  "description": "In this talk, we'll explore how maintaining a sense of fun and whimsy in\nscience has a profound effect on discovery, innovation and progress.\n\nWe'll also talk about some modern examples of how folks are ensuring\ntechnology remains not-so-serious, including some examples specific to\nthe Python community, and how some famous thinkers followed their\nnatural curiosity to keep science fun, all to great success.\n\nAnd finally, we'll discuss how you and I can keep computing fun on a\nday-to- day basis, maintain and nurture our natural curiosity, and just\nbe open to the unknown, all to the benefit of our field, those we work\nwith, and ourselves.\n",
