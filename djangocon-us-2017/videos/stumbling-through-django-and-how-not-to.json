  "description": "DjangoCon US 2017 - Stumbling Through Django and How Not To by Melanie Crutchfield\n\nIf you\u2019re a beginner about to embark on a new Django project adventure, this talk is for you.\n\nWhen I started my first Django project, I took the \u201cSure, I think I can figure that out\u201d approach, which is fun! And also dangerous. But exciting! And also horrible because I caused myself a lot of trouble and barfed on my keyboard. (Metaphorically.) Oops.\n\nMy hope for this talk is to pass along lessons I learned the hard way, and save the world. Or at least prevent some frustration. :) We\u2019ll talk about version control, structuring your project, and how to handle top secret stuff. We\u2019ll also talk about throwing house parties without causing anaphylaxis, pregnant daddy seahorses, velociraptors, and friends. I promise all of that is related to Django.\n\nhttps://2017.djangocon.us/talks/stumbling-through-django-and-how-not-to/",
