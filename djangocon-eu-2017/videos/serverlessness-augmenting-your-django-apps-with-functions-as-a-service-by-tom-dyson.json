  "description": "So-called 'serverless' platforms promise to free developers from having to worry about operating systems, hard disks, backups and scaling. Amazon, Google and Microsoft each have their own take on the serverless model, and recent third party abstractions make it much simpler to get started with Functions-as-a-Service.\n\nTom will take you through the pros and cons of the serverless model, and use a set of practical case studies to demonstrate ways that Django developers can take advantage of this emerging shift in the way that we host our applications.",
