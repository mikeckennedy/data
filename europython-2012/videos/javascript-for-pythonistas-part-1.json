  "description": "With the growth of AJAX and other client-side technologies many Python\nprogrammers, web-applications increasingly involve large amounts of\nJavaScript. Many of us find that, just to keep doing our job, we have\nunderstand JavaScript better. This tutorial, which was also given at\nEuroPython 2009, 2010 and 2011, provides an introduction to JavaScript\nthat emphasises the similarities and differences between Python and\nJavaScript. It has a focus on the concepts underlying JavaScript, and in\nparticular the object model and the lack of built-in classes. It also\ncovers quite a few JavaScript gotchas and other traps for the unwary.\nThis course is suitable for those who are Beginners or better in Python.\nPrevious JavaScript knowledge is not required, but would helpful. This\ncourse was prepared and previously delivered by Jonathan Fine. I was\nassisting in the course in 2010 as a helper and worked a little on\nimproving the materials during the sprints. I intend to improve the\nmaterials further and bring them up to date with recent developments in\nthe JavaScript world, and then deliver the tutorial, because Jonathan\nwill not be attending the conference this year.\n",
