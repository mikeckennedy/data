  "description": "Users will learn how to plot some of the most common types of data- such as discrete, continuous and categorical, in 1D and 2D - using Matplotlib. In doing so, this tutorial will unpack some of the fundamental concepts that underlie the architecture of Matplotlib. Using these concepts, attendees will learn how to change the \"look and feel\" of plots. The concepts taught in this tutorial will lay the foundation for creating effective visualizations using Matplotlib.",
