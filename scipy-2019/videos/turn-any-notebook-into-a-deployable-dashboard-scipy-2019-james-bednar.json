  "description": "Panel (panel.pyviz.org) is a new package that lets you create custom interactive apps and dashboards by connecting user-defined widgets to plots, images, tables, or text. Compared to other approaches, Panel is novel in that it works across nearly all plotting libraries, works just as well in a Jupyter notebook as on a standalone secure web server, uses the same code for both those cases, supports both Python-backed and static HTML/JavaScript exported applications, and can be used to develop rich interactive applications without tying your domain-specific code to any particular GUI or web tools.",
