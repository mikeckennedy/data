  "description": "Classic recommender systems are great for answering the question \u201cwhat does a user want in general?\u201d. However, they only get you partway to an answer to \u201cwhat does a user want right now?\u201d. To close the gap, it helps to capture and act on real-time user intent. I\u2019ll share examples of this paradigm, and the resulting changes to our algorithms and architectures.",
