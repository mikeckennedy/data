  "description": "Linear algebra is the foundational mathematical subject that everyone needs to know today. Get lost, calculus! Conventional presentations of linear algebra in undergraduate STEM curricula are overly focused on rules and memorization, overloaded with nomenclature, and slowed down by pen-and-paper methods. This tutorial skips the rule-based procedures and instead uses a visualization-rich approach and computation with NumPy to illuminate the concepts and usefulness of linear algebra. We promise a launching pad for participants to venture into this subject and continue learning after, with a solid conceptual grasp and none of the slog. You don't need previous experience in the subject; some recollection of having learned about matrices and linear systems of equations could help, but is not required.",
