  "summary": "Authors: Droettboom, Michael, STScI; Dencheva, Nadia, STScI; Aldcroft,\nTom, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for As\n\nTrack: General\n\nIn the process of developing the core tools in astropy, some modules\nhave been developed that have wider applicability than just for\nastronomy. This talk will describe these tools and the approach taken by\nastropy towards these. These include general tools for handling units,\nand quantities with units, with capabilities not found in other unit\npackages, such as equivalency mappings. We have also developed a generic\nsystem for defining models and interfacing models with generic fitting\nalgorithms in an easily extensible way. This system underlies our\napproach for mapping array coordinates to general world coordinate\nsystems. Finally, a powerful table interface has been developed that\nhandles many different data formats (currently focused mostly on\nastronomical varieties, but extensible to other fields as well).\n",
