  "abstract": "We often build multiple websites and applications that share the same\nstyles across multiple code bases (style guides/pattern libraries).\nMaintaining these styles becomes quite a task, and causes increasing\nfrustration overtime. Fortunately it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\nWithin this talk we\u2019ll cover a service-oriented architecture approach to\nwriting HTML and CSS, including Sass, and keeping our code modular and\nperformant. Geared towards designers and front-end developers, we\u2019ll\ndiscuss at how to best structure and write front-end code for\nmaintainability and reuse, as well as how to properly package these\nstyles to be used within different development environments. Consistency\nshouldn\u2019t take a back seat to maintainability, and this talk covers how\nto have the best of both worlds.\n",
