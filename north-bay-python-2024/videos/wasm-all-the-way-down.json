  "description": "WASM is a compiled set of instructions that can run in the browser and it can be used to as a compilation target. So, it's possible to compile CPython into WASM, like in PyOdide.\n\nIt's possible to write your own WASM interpreter, which can run those programs compiled to WASM. You can even write such a WASM interpreter in Python.\n\nYou can imagine what happens next: we're going to run Python in WASM in Python... and maybe more!\n",
