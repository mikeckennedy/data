  "description": "Python 102 (Part 1 of 3)\n\nThis half-day tutorial presents intermediate and some advanced features\nof Python to beginning and intermediate programmers. It pairs well with\nPython 101 following a similar outline but at a deeper level. Rather\nthan starting with \"Hello, world!\", we use the interactive Python\ninterpreter to get hands- on familiarity with much of core Python before\ncovering blocks and scripts. The tutorial is divided into short\nsections, each with presentation and exercises, to quickly cover lots of\nground. Advanced topics are introduced throughout and covered in \"extra\ncredit\" exercises such that more advanced participants can learn at\ntheir own pace.\n",
