  "description": "Artificial intelligence has been expanding across several areas of our\ndaily lives by getting embedded into billions of smart objects and IoT\ndevices. Securing such devices presents a number of unique challenges,\nsince they are deployed in uncontrolled, complex, and often hostile\nenvironments. Smart devices currently apply Machine Learning techniques\nto detect and mitigate security issues as they occur. The\never-increasing number of new security challenges however, requires them\nto predict and proactively protect against potential threats that may\noccur in the future by utilising Deep Learning techniques. In this talk,\nwe will discuss the security challenges facing the IoT networks, as well\nas desires and requirements for making the journey from Machine Learning\nto Deep Learning.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1810\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 3 May** at 12:00 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
