  "description": "This is a tutorial for beginners on using the Pandas library in Python for data manipulation. We will go from the basics of how to load and look at a dataset in pandas (python) for the first time, and begin the process of preparing data for analysis. The topics covered are: \n\n- Load and look at slices and views of data\n- Groupby aggregates to summarize data \n- Tidy and reshape data \n- Write functions and apply them to data \n- Plotting data using Seaborn\n- Encode dummy variables to prepare for analysis and model fit \n- Fitting a model using sklearn \n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you should have a solid foundation on working with datasets in Python. The last topic of encoding dummy variables segues into using other libraries, such as scikit-learn and statsmodels to fit models on your data.",
