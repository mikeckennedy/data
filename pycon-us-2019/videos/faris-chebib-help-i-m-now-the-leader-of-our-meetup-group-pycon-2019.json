  "description": "After attending your local dev meetup for months, you suddenly get the\ndreaded email: \"Your Organizer just stepped down without nominating a\nreplacement.\"\n\nBut the community relies on this meetup! It brings together devs from\nall around to engage in networking, learning, and comradery! So you step\nup. I mean, how hard could it be, right?\n\nOh no. This is much harder than you thought. You have to organize a\nvenue, figure out refreshments, get a speaker, ensure people show up.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn the skills need to start and sustain a\nvibrant meetup and tech community.\n",
