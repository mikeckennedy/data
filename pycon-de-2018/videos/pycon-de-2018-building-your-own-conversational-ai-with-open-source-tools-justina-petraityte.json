  "description": "Conversational AI is far from being a solved problem, but you don\u2019t need\nto rely on third-party APIs to build great chat and voice apps.\n\nIn this talk we will live-code a useful, engaging conversational AI bot\nbased entirely on machine learning. We\u2019ll be using Rasa NLU & Rasa Core,\nwhich are open source libraries for building machine learning-based\nchatbots and voice assistants. We will teach our system how to hold\nmulti-turn conversations by creating some initial training data, and\nthen refine its behaviour by interacting with the system and providing\nfeedback. We will cover the fundamentals of conversational AI, including\nthe most important algorithms for intent classification, entity\nextraction, and dialogue management.\n\nWhat will attendees learn:\n",
