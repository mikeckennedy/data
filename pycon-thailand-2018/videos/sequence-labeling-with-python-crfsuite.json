  "description": "Labeling sequences (any kind of sequences), using Python. E.g. using python-crfsuite, sklearn-crfsuite, PyStruct, pytorch-crf, and others. Not as trendy as \"deep learning\", but:\n- quite reliable, used in leading linguistic packages,\n- can give good results on limited training data (provided you can specify features, which requires domain knowledge),\n- but computationally intensive.\n\nColab Notebook: https://bit.ly/crf-wordseg https://bit.ly/crf-wordseg-slides ",
