  "description": "Database indexes play a key role in every database query. Hence, it's not a question that you should be able to define them through Django. While you're already kind of able to do that with `dbindex=true` and `index_together`, these options are rather limiting. Django 1.11 comes with a new feature to allow you to express your index requirements much more granular.",
