  "description": "A lot of people get started in open source by \u201cscratching their own itch\u201d \u2013 building something that they want for themselves. But starting the project isn't the hard part: it is keeping it going in a reasonable, sustainable way.\n\nI will be honest: creating and building a sustainable open community is hard. It involves giving up some control. It involves developing and exercising a different set of skills other than those needed for technical mastery. So how do you do it?\n\nI will start out with three stories about successful open communities, and explain how they were able to succeed. Then I will talk a little about why these communities work. It isn\u2019t fairy dust. It isn\u2019t even altruism. It\u2019s economics, psychology, and communication. Finally, I will give some guidelines around how you can build your own sustainable community.",
