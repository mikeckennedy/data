  "description": "How to write obfuscated python\n\nPresented by Rev. Johnny Healey\n\nWith its clean, highly readable syntax, Python would seem to be quite a\nchallenge for a programmer attempting to write obfuscated code.\nFortunately, it provides a wide variety of high-level abstractions that\ncan be misused in exciting ways. This survey of obfuscation strategies\nwill include topics such as decorator abuse, lambda calculus, and\nbytecode manipulation.\n\nAbstract\n\nPython's clean syntax can make traditional approaches to writing\nobfuscated code much more challenging. Fortunately, Python provides many\nuseful abstractions that can be misused to write code that is unreadable\nor even deliberately misleading. This talk will provide a survey of\nsilly python tricks that explore the boundaries of the language.\n\nTopics\n\n-  Redefining builtins\n-  Rarely used syntax\n-  Comparison edge cases\n-  Things you probably shouldn't do with decorators\n-  Fun with lambdas\n-  Bytecode manipulation\n\n",
