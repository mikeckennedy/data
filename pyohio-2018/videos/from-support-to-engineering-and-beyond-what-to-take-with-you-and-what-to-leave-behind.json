  "abstract": "I've had the special experience to, in an extraordinarily short amount\nof time, move from studying code independently to working full time on a\ncustomer-facing technical support team, to working as an full-stack\nengineer, to finally, leading an organization as Director of\nEngineering. In each transition, I've had to learn and use certain work\nskills to both get the current job done and prepare myself for my next.\nCome hear what attitudes, behaviors, work habits, and lessons I learned\nand chose to take with me, and what I intentionally left behind, as I\nmade these transitions -- and consider what you might take and leave\nbehind in your own journey.\n",
