  "description": "Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing product development. Phrased that way, it sounds cool and attractive. No wonder: we took the sentence from Wikipedia. Based on first-hand experience, however, we say scrum leaves a lot to be desired. \n\nAt Exponea we grew our IT and Product teams to 20 people in one year without giving excessive thought the process side. Instead, believing that the greatest asset is people, we have been focusing a lot on talent, motivation, engagement and opinions. In my contribution, I will cover how our team goes about software development, what we have tried and rejected, and how we choose to select future colleagues. It is believed our learnings can benefit small and big teams in startups and corporations alike.",
