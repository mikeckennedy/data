  "description": "This tutorial is a gentle introduction to Python for folks who are\ncompletely new to it and may not have much experience programming. We\u2019ll\nwork in a Jupyter Notebook, one of the most popular tools in scientific\nPython. You\u2019ll learn how to write beautiful Python while practicing\nloops, if\u2019s, functions, and usage of Python\u2019s built-in features in a\nseries of fun, interactive exercises. By the end of the tutorial we\nthink you\u2019ll be ready to write your own basic Python -- but most\nimportantly, we want you to learn the form and vocabulary of Python so\nthat you can understand Python documentation and interpret code written\nby others. To continue learning more about Python as it\u2019s applied to\ndata and science, join our companion tutorial titled Introduction to\nScientific Python.Presenter(s): Speaker: Matt Davis, Clover Health\nSpeaker: Alyssa Whitwell, Clover Health\n",
