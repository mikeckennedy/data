  "description": "\"Static Sites With Sphinx and Markdown\" by: Paul Everitt\nEverybody knows Sphinx for documenting projects, Python and otherwise. But few think of Sphinx for the rest of a website. \n\nWhy? Because Sphinx traditionally means authoring with reStructuredText instead of Markdown. While RST is very powerful, it's a bit quirky, and nowhere near the popularity of Markdown.\n\nBut with the arrival of full Markdown support MyST, and with static site generators having a renaissance, it's time to give Sphinx a second look. Sphinx is an \"information-rich\" static site generator, with rich linking and many other features for authoring a knowledge base.\n\nThis talk introduces Sphinx for websites, shows enabling MyST for Markdown, and compares what it has to offer versus other approaches. We\u2019ll do a light treatment of customization. All the material in this talk comes from a published tutorial.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
