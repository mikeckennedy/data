  "description": "Modern cars are networks of computers, and a high end vehicle could have\nnearly 100 different computers inside. These devices control everything\nfrom the engine to the airbags. By understanding how these systems work,\nwe can interface with vehicles to read data, perform diagnostics, and\neven modify operation.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss pyvit, the Python Vehicle Interface Toolkit.\nThis library, combined with some open source hardware, allows developers\nto talk to automotive controllers from Python.\n\nWe will begin with an introduction to automotive networks, to provide a\nbasis for understanding the tools. Next, we will look at the tools and\nshow the basics of using them. Finally, we'll discuss real world\napplications of these tools, and how they're being used in the\nautomotive world today.\n",
