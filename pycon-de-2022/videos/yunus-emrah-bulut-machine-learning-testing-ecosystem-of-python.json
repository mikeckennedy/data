    "description": "Speaker:: Yunus Emrah Bulut\n\nTrack: PyData: Machine Learning & Stats\nIn this talk, I'll present the growing ecosystem of machine learning testing tools in Python. Machine learning validation and testing is an emerging concern in the MLOps domain and will become more so in the near future as several states (including European Commission) will put regulations on AI in place. I'll talk about several types of machine learning vulnerabilities and the available toolkits in Python that help machine learning practitioners test their models.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/9UB3Z3\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
