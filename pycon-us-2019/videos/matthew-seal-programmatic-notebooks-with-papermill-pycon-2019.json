  "description": "Notebooks have traditionally been a tool for drafting code and avoiding\nrepeated expensive computations while exploring solutions. However, with\nnew tools like nteract's papermill and scrapbook libraries, this\ntechnology has been expanded to make a reusable and parameterizable\ntemplate for execution.\n\nWe'll walk though how Jupyter notebooks are being programmatically used\nat Netflix and how this helps with our batch processing world. We'll\nalso explore how these use cases connect back with users and why we've\nadopted these tools for Python and non-Python execution.\n",
