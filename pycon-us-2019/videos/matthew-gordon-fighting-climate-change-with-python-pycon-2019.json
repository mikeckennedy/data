  "description": "Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a 60 times more\npowerful climate change agent than carbon dioxide. Current technologies\nfor finding methane leaks in oil and gas infrastructure rely on driving\nwell to well with a handheld camera. At Kairos Aerospace, we have\ndeveloped a plane-mounted sensor for detecting methane leaks, but the\nsensor is only part of the solution: getting information off the sensor\nand into customers\u2019 hands required us to build an entire plane-to-report\npipeline. I\u2019ll discuss the challenges we faced in developing a scalable,\nreliable, and cost-effective scientific computing platform in Python,\nwith examples of novel solutions using Python\u2019s extensive ecosystem of\nGIS, cloud computing and machine learning tools.\n",
