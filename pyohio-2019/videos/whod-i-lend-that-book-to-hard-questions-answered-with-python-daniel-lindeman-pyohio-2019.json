  "description": "I love reading books, but I love lending them out even more! In order to\nkeep track of my personal library, a daunting task indeed, I\u2019ve employed\nPython, a Raspberry Pi, and an RFID reader. Take a tour through what\nit\u2019s like working with hardware, Python, and putting it all together\ninto a useful web application. This is a beginner friendly talk, so\ndon\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve never worked with hardware\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is here to stay, but getting started can\nseem intimidating. Inspired by the magical checkout process at my local\nlibrary, I began the journey of building my own IoT book lending\napplication. Along the way, I discovered that Python was consistently\nable to make the impossible seem approachable!\n\nWe\u2019ll start with a base installation of Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi and\nfind that Python is already there waiting to help. Then we\u2019ll hook up an\nRFID reader to our Pi, and see that even though it has wires and pins,\nit\u2019s nothing to be scared of. With the RFID reader and the fantastic\nMFRC522-python library, we\u2019re able to read and write data to RFID\nstickers, neat!\n\nWe could stop here, but we\u2019ve got Python, so let\u2019s hook it up to a Flask\napp and end at a complete book lending application. I hope attendees\nwill gain an appreciation for the technology all around them, their\nlocal library, and how powerful Python is. I hope to demystify working\nwith hardware and dispel some perceived barriers to entry for IoT\napplications.\n",
