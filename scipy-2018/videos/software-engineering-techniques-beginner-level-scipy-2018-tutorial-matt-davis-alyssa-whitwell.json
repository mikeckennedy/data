  "description": "As a user of scientific Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and\nmatplotlib it\u2019s worth asking how the maintainers of those libraries\nmanage to keep the codebases running quickly and correctly when there\nare large codebases, many features, and many contributors. Those\ndevelopers have to think deliberately about the design of their code;\nthey use a number of techniques to make their lives easier, among them\ntesting, debugging, profiling, and packaging. Exactly as these\ntechniques are useful to library maintainers, they can also be useful to\nresearchers, data scientists, and analysts who are trying keep code fast\nand correct as it undergoes changes. This tutorial will introduce\nattendees to deliberate code design, testing using the pytest framework,\nPython\u2019s debugging tools, profiling code to understand performance, and\nhow to reuse code in multiple places.Presenter(s): Speaker: Matt Davis,\nClover Health Speaker: Alyssa Whitwell, Clover Health\n",
