  "description": "A frenetic combination of educational and entertaining segments, as chosen\nby the audience! In between segments, audience members will shout out\nnumbers from a menu, and we\u2019ll perform the selected segment: it may be a\nshort monologue, it may be a play, it may be a physical demo, or it may be a\ntiny traditional conference talk.\n\nAudience members should walk away with some additional understanding of the\nhistory of Python, knowledge of some tools and libraries available in the\nPython ecosystem, and some Python-related amusement.\n\nThis talk is inspired by [the Neo-Futurists\u2019 Infinite\nWrench](http://www.nyneofuturists.org/), a creative and energetic piece of\ntheater.\n\nThe audience can select from these plays:\n\n1. The Unvarnished Truth\n2. <tt>from import import import</tt>\n3. WHAT'S the DEAL with CLIENTS?\n4. A Play Entirely Full of Monty Python References\n5. A Proposal for Explaining PEPs\n6.
