  "description": "It's often said that Python comes with batteries included, meaning that\nthe standard library can do basically anything except for maybe conjure\nbacon for you (though I heard that's coming in 3.8). I don't think we\nfully appreciate the sheer vastness of it, though, so I went through it\nmodule by module looking for hidden gems (sorry, eggs). This is a by no\nmeans exhaustive compilation of the useful, the underrated, and the\nfunny.\n\nWhen it comes to the Python standard library, chances are you use it on\na daily basis -- or more likely, a more or less stable subset of it. The\nusual way we add things to the subset is by looking for a solution to a\nproblem and ending up getting pointed to a standard library module.\nThat, however, means that the odds of you finding out that there is a\nwhole module whose sole purpose is to tell you if a string is a Python\nkeyword are very slim.\n\nThe aim of this talk is to showcase CPython libraries that are\ninteresting in some way: mostly for their usefulness, but in some cases\nsimply for being wonderfully weird in some way. The talk is not aimed at\nany particular level of Python experience - as a beginner you'll get a\ntaste of just how many batteries Python ships with, and as a person\nusing the language often you might end up growing your own personal\nsubset a bit more.",
