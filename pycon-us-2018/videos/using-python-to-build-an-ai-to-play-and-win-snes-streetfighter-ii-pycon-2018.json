We\u2019ll cover how Python provided the\nkey glue between the SNES emulator and AI, and how the AI was built with\n``gym``, ``keras-rl`` and ``tensorflow``. We\u2019ll show examples of game\nplay and training, and talk about which bot beat which bot in the\nbot-v-bot tournament we ran.\n\nAfter this talk you\u2019ll know how easy it is to use Python and Python\u2019s\nmachine learning libraries to teach a computer to play games. You\u2019ll see\na practical example of the same type of machine learning used by\nAlphaGo, and also get to find out which character in StreetFighter II is\nbest to pick when playing your friends.",
