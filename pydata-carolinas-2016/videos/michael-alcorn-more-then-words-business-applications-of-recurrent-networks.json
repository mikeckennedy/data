For companies\nthat follow a subscription business model, sequential data can often\nbe found in abundance, seemingly making recurrent neural networks a\nperfect fit for many prediction tasks. Unfortunately, resources\ndescribing how to leverage the power of recurrent neural networks in\nnon-language settings are generally lacking. At Red Hat, we\u2019re using\nrecurrent neural networks to tackle a number of different business\ngoals, including predicting customer churn and prioritizing support\ncases. During this talk, you\u2019ll learn about Red Hat\u2019s full deep\nlearning pipeline, from data collection (e.g., mining website logs on\nHadoop clusters and pulling data from SQL databases), to data\npreprocessing (e.g., dimensionality reduction in scikit-learn), to\nprediction. By the end, you\u2019ll have the foundation necessary to begin\nimplementing your own recurrent neural network solutions.",
