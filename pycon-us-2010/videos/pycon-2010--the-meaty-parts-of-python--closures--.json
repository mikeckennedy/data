  "description": "The Meaty Parts of Python: Closures, Decorators, List Comprehension, and\nFunctional Constructs\n\nPresented by Matt Harrison\n\nAre you new to Python and want to learn how to step it up to the next\nlevel? Have you wondered about functional programming, closures,\ndecorators, generators or list comprehensions and when you should use\nthem? This hands-on tutorial will cover these intermediate subjects in\ndetail, by explaining the theory behind them then walking through\nexamples. It will also cover how to test such programs. The session will\nconclude with some basic problems to work through.\n\nOutline:\n\n-  Testing (45 min)\n\n   -  unittest\n   -  doctest\n   -  brief code coverage intro\n   -  other testing tools\n\n-  Functional Programming (15 min)\n\n   -  lambda\n   -  map\n   -  reduce\n   -  filter\n   -  Substitutes for above constructs\n\n-  Functions (20 min)\n\n   -  callables\n   -  arguments (args, kw)\n   -  mutable parameters\n\n-  Scoping (10 min)\n-  Closures (5 min)\n-  Decorators (20 min)\n\n   -  Simple decorators\n   -  parameterized decorators\n   -  mangling\n   -  templates for decorators\n   -  classmethod staticmethod\n\n-  Properties (5 min)\n-  List comprehensions (10 min)\n-  Iterator pattern (5 min)\n-  Generators (15 min )\n-  Hands-on application (50 min)\n\n",
