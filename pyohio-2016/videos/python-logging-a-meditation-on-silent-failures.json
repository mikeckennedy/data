  "description": "Logging is a part of sane, stable development. Python developers should treat logging with the same weight that we take unit tests. Logs can be just as important as test coverage for unearthing breaking changes in code. This talk will introduce the concept of logging, its use cases, and how to set up a custom log formatter you can tailor to your application's specific needs.",
