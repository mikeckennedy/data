  "description": "PyPy is probably the fastest Python implementation around. The first part of this talk will present various aspects of the implementation: the translation and analysis framework, and its famous tracing JIT. PyPy is no longer a research curiosity and is now suitable for production use. In the second part we'll talk about PyPy's present and future status, the compatibility issues you may encounter, and discuss for what kinds of applications it might be useful.",
