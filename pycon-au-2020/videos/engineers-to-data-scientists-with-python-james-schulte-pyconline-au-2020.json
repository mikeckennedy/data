  "description": "James Schulte\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/BAC9R3\n\nThis talk centers around an early stage start-up reaching the scale-up phase of growth and having to move from an ad-hoc collection of MATLAB scripts to a functioning Python analysis pipeline. All while transforming a team of mechanical engineers into a functioning software engineering and data-science team.\r\n\r\nI will paint a picture of the work we do, and how the product was first created - including the wild selection of technologies, before talking about some of the challenges faced in migrating a large monolithic product to a modular codebase. I\u2019ll discuss some the advantages and pitfalls of using Python, and how we trained non-software engineers to produce quality code.\r\n\r\nThe talk has something for everyone, whether you\u2019re a tech-lead responsible for training & developing your team, a business leader in a scaling startup, or a junior engineer thinking about how to improve.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 11:00:00 2020 at Obvious",
