    "description": "Speaker:: Antoine Toubhans\n\nTrack: PyData: PyData & Scientific Libraries Stack\nThere are tons of tools to do data science. Too often, data scientists end up using a monolithic AI platform that \u201cdoes everything by clicking on a UI\u201d. In this talk, I will walk you through a pythonic and flexible ML experiment tracking system based on 1) GIT \ud83d\ude42 2) [DVC](https://dvc.org/) (Data Version Control) to track the data 3) [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to build a data exploration app. I will quickly introduce the tools separately and then focus on how they can be combined together to build a tailor-made experiment tracking system.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/WADNGC\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
