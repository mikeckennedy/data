  "description": "Deep learning is all the rage these days, but what do you do when your data isn\u2019t handwritten digits, or pictures of cats? Geospatial data comes with it\u2019s own unique challenges\u2014huge high dimensional datasets in weird file formats, irregular and often mismatched grids, and a pervasive lack of labeled training data\u2026 to name just a few! In this talk, we\u2019ll explore cutting up and resampling giant remote sensing rasters using modern python tools like rasterio, georasters, and GDAL; detrending, extracting, and storing information with pandas; sensible dataset and dimensionality reduction through scipy transforms; and a few places to go in Keras and other deep learning libraries. Come learn how to jump from satellite or airborne data to your own \u201cgeoMINST\u201d database that\u2019s ingestible to your favorite deep learning technique!",
