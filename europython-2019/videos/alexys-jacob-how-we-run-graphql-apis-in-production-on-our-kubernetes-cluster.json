  "description": "In this talk I would like to share the workflow and tools we use to\nbuild, deploy and operate GraphQL APIs on our on-premise Kubernetes\ncluster.\n\nI will share code and command examples explaining how we are operating\nour applications since our recent transition from REST APIs on Web\nservers to GraphQL APIs containers on Kubernetes.\n\nThis talk will not be about the difference between REST and GraphQL but\nfocus on the workflow, tools and experience we gained in switching our\nrun time environments and API models.\n\nAt Numberly, we have built and are operating our own on-premise\nKubernetes cluster so we will also be talking about its capabilities and\nshare some of the experience we gained in doing so.\n\n| Proposed agenda:\n| - Our previous workflow and its limitations\n| - How we designed our Kubernetes cluster, its capabilities and the\n  choices we made\n| - Developer workflow, environments management and deployment\n| - Our GraphQL stack, featuring a sample application\n| - What we're still working on to improve",
