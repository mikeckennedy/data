  "description": "How we are using social network analysis to understand palatability in dog food recipes\n\nI\u2019m a data scientist working for a tailor made dog food company, and in\nthis session I\u2019ll explain how we are applying ideas in social network\nanalysis to understand and improve the overall taste and palatability of\nour dry dog food recipes.\n\nUnderstanding what makes dog food delicious is a difficult problem to\nsolve, and as the intended consumers of our food are dogs, this presents\nsome obvious limitations to the methods available to approach this\nproblem.\n\nI am taking a fairly unique and data led approach to this, using ideas\nin social network analysis to visualise our dog food recipes and find\ningredients (or combinations of ingredients) common in recipes where we\nknow that the dog didn\u2019t like the recipe.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll tell the story of how this project evolved, and how\nwe\u2019ve been using the Python library NetworkX to help us create some\nreally insightful visualisations of our data. Along the way I\u2019ll cover\nsome of the great things about this library, as well as some of the\npitfalls.",
