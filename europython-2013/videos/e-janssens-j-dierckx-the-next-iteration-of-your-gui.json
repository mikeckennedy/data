  "description": "This talk will show how GUI applications written as a series of\ngenerators are fun to write, responsive, user friendly and easy to unit\ntest. We dive into the details of language functions of PEP 342\n(Coroutines via Enhanced Generators) and PEP 380 (Syntax for Delegating\nto a Subgenerator). With this knowledge refreshed, we discuss why and\nhow these functions can be integrated in an event loop. Then we\ndemonstrate how we used these functions to rewrite all the asynchronous\noperations of the Camelot framework and avoided series of callbacks\ntransforming the code from complicated to beatiful.\n",
