  "description": "I\u2019m currently working in a Django project, We have a lot of tests (~\n2000) and a fair amount of code coverage currently. The system and the\nrequirements of the client grows everyday (like in every other project\nthese days). I\u2019ve convinced that the effort we put in making each of\nthese tests pays off daily.\n\nSpeaking with other Django and Python developers I\u2019ve noticed that\npeople often \u201coverengineer\u201d their unit tests and they usually tend to\nbreak their principles.\n\nIn this presentation I will talk mainly about unit tests. - what\npackages we use and how and when to use them (properly). We will take a\nlook on how we structure our projects and how this structure actually\nhelps us write proper unit tests. I will start with the very basic tests\nand continue with the mocking technique. In the end I\u2019m going to refer\nto other testing methods (integration, E2E, validation testing, visual\nregression, etc.).\n\nThe goal of this talk is to make people better in testing and to show\nthem how these skills will fasten the development process and help them\nmaintain their project and it\u2019s quality.\n",
