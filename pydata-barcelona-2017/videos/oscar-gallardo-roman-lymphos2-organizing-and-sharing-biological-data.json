  "description": "The study of the proteome (the set of proteins expressed by a cell,\ntissue, or organism at a defined time and conditions) generates a large\namount of complex data. This data should be processed, stored, curated,\nand made easily available to researchers so it can be studied to obtain\nbiomedical knowledge. In this talk we expose the Python tools we have\nused and developed to accomplish it.\n\nAbstract\n~~~~~~~~\n\n\nAt the `LP-CSIC/UAB`_ we use a technology called `Mass Spectrometry`_ to\nstudy the *phospho-proteome of human T-Lymphocytes*; this is, the group\nof proteins that are phosphorilated (modified with phosphate groups) in\nthe human `T cells`_ during their activation and differentiation as part\nof the `immune response`_. The experiments involved in this study\ngenerates a *large* amount of *complex* data:\n\n-  Experimental conditions and procedures metadata.\n-  The spectra data and metadata obtained from the mass spectrometers\n   (usually in proprietary binary formats).\n-  Qualitative or identification data, consisting of search results of\n   those spectra against human protein sequence databases (using\n   multiple search engines, that use different output file-formats)\n   linking the spectra with possible peptides (small protein sequence\n   fragments) that may or may not contain phosphorylated amino-acids.\n-  Semi-quantitative data about the abundance of each possible\n   identified peptide.\n-  Missing values, identification scores, phosphorylation reassignments,\n   and a lot of relationships and inter-linked data\u2026\n\nAnd all this data has to be **processed**, **stored**, **curated**, and\nmade **easily accessible** to researchers in our lab and worldwide, so\nthey can study it to obtain biomedical knowledge about the\nphosphorylation changes in peptides and proteins involved in the signal\ntransduction pathways of T cells after their activation during the\nspecific immune response.\n\nWe have used different Python *packages* to develop different tools and\napplications to accomplish those objectives:\n\n-  The `EasierMgf`_ front-end application, to extract plain text spectra\n   data from proprietary binary mass spectrometer files, was developed\n   using the `wxPython`_ GUI toolkit.\n-  The `ORM`_ from the `django`_ framework was used to design and\n   interact with the LymPHOS2 `MySQL`_ database, which stores all the\n   data and their inter-relationships.\n-  Also, different modules from the Python standard library (*json*,\n   *xml.etree.ElementTree*, *csv*, *zipfile*) were used to read and\n   `import`_ into the database the different files containing the data;\n   and to `export`_ database data into commonly used file formats for\n   the researches to work with.\n-  The `PQuantifier`_ group of tools was developed to do the statistical\n   processing and analysis of the LymPHOS2 semi-quantitative data. It\n   uses the `SQLAlchemy`_ ORM for fast database storage in local\n   `SQLite`_ files, the `NumPy`_ N-dimensional array package, the\n   `SciPy`_ scientific computing library for the statistics, the\n   `uncertainties`_ package for calculations with error propagation,\n   and the `matplotlib`_ 2D plotting library for some nice plots of\n   data distributions.\n-  And the full django framework itself was used to develop the\n   `LymPHOS2`_ web application. Which also uses the matplotlib library\n   to dynamically generate the mass spectra images.\n\nThe final result is the `LymPHOS2 <https://bitbucket.org/lp-csic-uab/lymphosweb/branch/Web_LymPHOS_2>`__ web-oriented database, that\nnowadays (2017) contains 131.908 mass spectra, 15.566 phosphorylation\nsites from 8.273 unique phospho-peptides and 4.937 proteins (which\nrepresent a 45-fold increase over the original LymPHOS database of\n2009); aside from the new quantitative data for 1.975 of the identified\nphospho-peptides, which was not present in the previous version of\nLymPHOS.\n\n**Repositories and Presentation Slides:**\n\n-  Bitbucket code repositories: https://bitbucket.org/lp-csic-uab/\n-  Presentation Slides (.ODP, .PDF and .PPTX):\n   https://bitbucket.org/lp-csic-uab/lymphosdocs/downloads/\n\n**Credits:**\n\nThe exposed work has been carried out at `LP-CSIC/UAB`_ from\n`Catalonia`_, part of the `Spanish National Research Council (Consejo\nSuperior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas - CSIC)`_ and of `ProteoRed\n(Proteomics National NetWork Platform)`_.\n\nThe *people* who have participated directly in the current work are:\n\n-  **Data analysis, bioinformatics and informatics**: *Joaquin Abian*\n   and *\u00d3scar Gallardo*.\n-  **Mass Spectrometry, experimental design and implementation**:\n   *Montserrat Carrascal*, *Nguyen Tien Dung* and *Oriol Vidal-Cortes*.\n-  **Sample preparation**: *Montserrat Carrascal*, *Nguyen Tien Dung*,\n   *Oriol Vidal-Cortes* and *Vanessa Casas*.\n-  **Past collaborators**: *David Ovelleiro* and *Marina Gay*.\n-  **Direction**: *Joaquin Abian*.\n\n.. _LymPHOS2: http://www.lymphos.org\n.. _LP-CSIC/UAB: http://proteomica.uab.cat\n.. _Catalonia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia\n.. _Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas - CSIC): http://www.csic.es/\n.. _ProteoRed (Proteomics National NetWork Platform): http://www.proteored.org/\n.. _Mass Spectrometry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry\n.. _T cells: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell\n.. _immune response: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response\n.. _EasierMgf: https://bitbucket.org/lp-csic-uab/easiermgf\n.. _wxPython: https://wxpython.org/\n.. _ORM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping\n.. _django: https://www.djangoproject.com/\n.. _MySQL: https://www.mysql.com/\n.. _import: https://bitbucket.org/lp-csic-uab/lymphosweb/src/c127cd7a88a5dfb0a70b9e3b6243553c6adda6fb/src/LymPHOS_v1_5/lymphos/filters.py\n.. _export: https://bitbucket.org/lp-csic-uab/lymphostools\n.. _PQuantifier: https://bitbucket.org/lp-csic-uab/lymphospquantifier\n.. _SQLAlchemy: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\n.. _SQLite: https://sqlite.org/\n.. _NumPy: https://www.numpy.org/\n.. _SciPy: https://scipy.org/scipylib\n.. _uncertainties: https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/\n.. _matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/",
