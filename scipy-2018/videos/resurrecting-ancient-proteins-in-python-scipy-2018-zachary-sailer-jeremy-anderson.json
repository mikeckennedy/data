  "description": "All living organisms evolved from an ancient set of ancestors. That\nmeans, the proteins that make up these organisms also evolved from an\nancient set. Over a few billion years, evolution improvised,\ndiversified, and specialized these proteins to meet life\u2019s demands. How\ndid evolution do this? To explore this question, we use Python to infer\nancient, ancestral proteins from modern protein families. We then\nsynthesize these ancestors in lab and identify key changes that led to\nnew evolutionary innovations. In this talk, we will resurrect an ancient\nprotein and trace its evolutionary history in a single Jupyter\nNotebook.Presenter(s): Speaker: Zachary Sailer, University of Oregon\nSpeaker: Jeremy Anderson, University of Oregon\n",
