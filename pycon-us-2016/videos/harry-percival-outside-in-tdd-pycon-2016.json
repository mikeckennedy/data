  "description": "Speaker: Harry Percival\n\nAn intermediate-level Test-Driven-Development workshop, presented as a hands-on exploration of \"\"outside-in\"\" TDD, in the style of a code-dojo code kata.  Will include discussion of \"\"double-loop\"\" BDD/TDD, outside-in vs inside-out, a detailed discussion of the pros + cons of mocking, test isolation, letting the tests drive design, and what are tests for anyway?\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
