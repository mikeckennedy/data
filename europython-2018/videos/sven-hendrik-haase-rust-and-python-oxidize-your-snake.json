  "description": "Rust is a safe and modern systems programming language that is easily\nable to call and be called from Python. As such, it is a prime candidate\nfor replacing C for writing Python modules that have to be fast or that\nhave to interact with other native code. Rust is extremely fast and\nmakes it very hard to get concurrency wrong.\n\nMany ways of making Python call into lower level have appeared over the\nyears such as CFFI, ctypes, boost.python, cython, SWIG. All of them are\ncumbersome in their own ways. PyO3 is a Rust library that makes it easy\nand simple to write native Python modules with minimal glue code and no\ncrazy tooling required. It even works cross-platform without problems.\n\nThe talk shows some sample code of PyO3-based modules and compares it\nwith the code of the alternatives as well as the alternative\u2019s\ncross-platform support and tooling.\n\nThe goal is for the audience to be informed about a new safe and modern\nway of writing native Python modules.\n\nThe audience doesn\u2019t need any prerequisites except for a healthy\ninterest in native code and Python modules. C knowledge is optional.\n",
