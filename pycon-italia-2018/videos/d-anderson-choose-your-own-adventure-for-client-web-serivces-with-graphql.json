We\u2019ll work up from shared principals with\ntraditional REST web services to the new paradigm of data specific to\neach client request and how this makes backend and frontend developers\nhappier and more productive.\n\nAudience Experience\n===================\n\nIntermediate (requires some knowledge of Python, Django, REST web\nservices, etc. But will try to build a shared understanding of the core\nconcepts).\n\nDuration\n========\n\n45 minutes\n\n-  About me, Prologue to the Adventure (5m)\n-  Chapter 1 - Architecture and Design (15m)\n-  Chapter 2 - Advanced Considerations (Authentication, Scaling,\n   Performance, Rate Limiting, etc.) (10m)\n-  Chapter 3 - Authentication and Building a Rich Client Web Application\n   (10m)\n-  Epilogue + Questions (5m)\n\nin \\_\\_on **domenica 22 aprile** at 11:15 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
