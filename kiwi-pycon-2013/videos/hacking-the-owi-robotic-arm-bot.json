  "description": "@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Saturday, 07 Sep 2013 - Track 1\n\n**Audience level**\n\nNovice\n\n**Abstract**\n\nAfter buying my son an OWI robotic arm,we decided to see if we could do\nmore with it than use the remote controller. We quickly found you can\nbuy a USB interface, however it only came with windows drivers. After\nsome googling we found we could control this with python scripts which\nled to even more fun!\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/liz-quilty-hacking-the-owi-robotic-arm-bot\n",
