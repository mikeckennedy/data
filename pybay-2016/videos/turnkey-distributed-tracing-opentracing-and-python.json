  "description": "This talk underlines the importance of distributed tracing in microservices, reveals the need for standardization of tracing instrumentation, and explains how the OpenTracing project addresses that need. We will showcase OpenTracing\u2019s set of consistent, expressive, explicitly vendor-neutral tracing APIs with working examples using python gRPC, Flask, and possibly other frameworks if time allows.\n\u200b\nAbstract\nMicroservice architectures offer many benefits but are notoriously difficult to observe or debug, especially as transactions inevitably cross process boundaries. I focused on this problem at Google and built Dapper, Google\u2019s production distributed tracing system. I learned from Dapper\u2019s design eccentricities that\u2014in order to facilitate ubiquitous, transparent distributed tracing in OSS-heavy applications\u2014as an industry we must find a way to make open-source software components interoperate from a tracing standpoint.\n \nThis need for standardized tracing instrumentation across open source brings us to OpenTracing. By offering consistent, expressive, vendor-neutral, open-source APIs for popular platforms, OpenTracing provides a semantic and syntactic standard for distributed tracing instrumentation, allowing developers to add (or switch) tracing implementations with an O(1) configuration change.\n\nI will explain OpenTracing\u2019s data model and the motivations behind it, describe how it generalizes across tracing systems and instrumentation languages (with a focus on Python), and show demos of how it integrates with frameworks (like Flask and gRPC) and applications. We will then cover the \u201chello world\u201d of tracing: creating and linking traces that traverse process boundaries. Finally, I\u2019ll share what\u2019s in store for the rest of 2016 and 2017 and talk about ways to get involved.",
