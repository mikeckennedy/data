  "description": "Two Pythonistas, one city break, one challenge:\u00a0re-create a train announcement board on a RaspberryPi-powered LCD\n\nThis talk will tell our story \u2013 two friends who were curious what trains\nwere going past one of their houses every five minutes.\n\nRather than buy an over-priced Windows-powered monstrosity(!), we'll\nexplain how we built an open-source train announcement board using an\nLCD display, powered by a RaspberryPi. We'll run through how we started\nwith way too grand a plan, how we de-scoped the project and how we built\nit over the course of a weekend city break. Naturally, the talk will end\nwith a demo!\n\nAttendees should come to learn what it takes to scrape train data and\npresent it on a RaspberryPi LCD but stay to hear about coding city\nbreaks!",
