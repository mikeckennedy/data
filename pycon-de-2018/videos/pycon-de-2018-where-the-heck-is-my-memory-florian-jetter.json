  "description": "Memory management is something the common Python user doesn\u2019t need to\nbother with because the gory details of it are hidden deep within the\ninterpreter itself. The garbage collector takes out the trash and we can\nspend our precious time bothering with more important things on our\nminds. Living in this encapsulated utopia is nice but sometimes it is\nworth it to peak behind the curtains to unleash the full power of your\napplication. In this talk I want to show you when it is necessary to\nface this harsh world and convince you that it is in fact not as scary\nas it may seem. Using real life examples, I\u2019m going to show you how to\nuse the garbage collector and open source tooling to get control over\nthe memory you might not even know you had at your disposal.\n",
