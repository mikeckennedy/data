  "description": "In this talk, you will learn various optimization techniques to improve\nthe runtime performance of your deep learning algorithms on Intel\narchitecture. The presentation will cover how to accelerate the training\nof your deep neural networks with Tensorflow thanks to the highly\noptimized Intel\u00ae Math Kernel Library (Intel\u00ae MKL) and how we boost\ninferencing with Intel\u00ae nGraph and with the Intel\u00ae Distribution of\nOpenVINO\u2122.",
