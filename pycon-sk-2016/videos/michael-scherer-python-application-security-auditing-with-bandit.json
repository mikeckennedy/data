  "description": "While more and more code is written and connected on the internet,\nsecurity has never been so important for software. However, security is\noften relegated as a 2nd thought and solution to scale it had to be\nfound by the industry theses days.\n\nA proven strategy is to use automatic static code analysis, a technique\napplied by tools such as Coverty or Clang, and mostly used for C code.\n\nBut not all software is written in C, so this talk will present bandit,\na tool to detect dangerous python code, and will explain the different\ntypes of flaws developers have to keep in mind when writing code, and\nwhy static code analysis is not a silver bullet, but just one of the\nnumerous way we can improve security.\n",
