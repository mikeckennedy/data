  "description": "Bringing a machine learning project to a successful conclusion is more\ndifficult than it may seem upfront. We have to take into consideration\nfull machine learning lifecycle, which allows focusing not only on the\ndevelopment of the model but also on the production and monitoring\nparts. During this tutorial, we practice building full machine learning\nlifecycle using MLFlow as the main tool.\n\nTutorial instructions and data can be found here (make sure to check\nprior to event): **`github\nlink <https://github.com/osin-vladimir/mlflow_tutorial>`__**\n\nBringing a machine learning project to a successful conclusion is more\ndifficult than it may seem upfront. We have to take into consideration\nfull machine learning lifecycle, which allows focusing not only on the\ndevelopment of the model but also on the production and monitoring\nparts. Thankfully, there are mature tools available to manage machine\nlearning lifecycle. One of the tools for end-to-end machine learning\nlifecycle management is the open- source platform MLflow.\n\nDuring the tutorial we are going to deep dive into main MLFlow\ncomponents:\n\n-  MLflow tracking: using an API and UI to track/log/visualize machine\n   learning experiments.\n-  Mlflow projects: using standardized format to package reusable data\n   science code.\n-  Mlflow models: using provided tools to deploy common model types to\n   diverse platforms.\n",
