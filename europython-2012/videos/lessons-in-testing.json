  "description": "Testing may be one of the more difficult concepts to pick up in a\ndevelopment cycle. With the complexities of large projects, and even\nsmall projects, writing effective, automated tests can take many times\nlonger than writing the code and testing it by hand. This talk will\nexplore the various patterns of testing that DISQUS has implemented, and\niterated upon over the last two years. It will describe how testing has\nbeen used to speed up the product lifecycle, improve stability through\nautomation, and the culture shift required to get there. Most\nimportantly, it will cover the practices that have been put in place\nthat have helped ease the burden of writing tests.\n",
