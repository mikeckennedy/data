  "description": "My presentation is focused mainly on my teaching experience in a high\nschool using VPython. I've posed some problems to my students to solve\nwith VPython: from basic static building representations like castle to\nmore complex dynamic models like bouncing balls. This approach seems a\ngood way to get in touch with computer programming concepts and to link\ncomputer science with other disciplines like Math, Geometry, Physics,\nChemistry\n",
