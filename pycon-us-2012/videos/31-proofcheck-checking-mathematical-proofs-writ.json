  "summary": "ProofCheck is a set of Python scripts which parse and check mathematics\nwritten using TeX. Its homepage is www.proofcheck.org. Unlike computer\nproof assistants which require immersion in the equivalent of a\nprogramming language, ProofCheck attempts to handle mathematical\nlanguage formalized according to the author's preferences as much as\npossible.\n",
