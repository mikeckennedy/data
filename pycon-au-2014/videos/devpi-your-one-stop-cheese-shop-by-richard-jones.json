  "description": "Modern Python developers depend on a large number of 3rd party packages.\nThis in turn introduces a problem: how to manage those packages for\nrapid, reliable deployment in a world where the central repository -\nPyPi (the Cheese Shop) - is out of their control. Additionally, private\npackages may be developed which need to seamlessly be integrated into\nthe deployment systems.\n\nIn this talk I will present devpi, a PyPI (Cheese Shop) server and\npackaging/testing/release tool. I will cover its reasons for existing,\nits many capabilities and configuration for some common scenarios.\n",
