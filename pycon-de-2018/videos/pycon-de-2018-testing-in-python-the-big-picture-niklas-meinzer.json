In this talk, we will take a look at different\naspects of software testing and find out what the Python ecosystem has\nto offer for our testing needs.\n\n*Tags:* Programming, Python\n\nScheduled on `wednesday 16:35 </schedule/#wed-16:35-lecture>`__ in room\nlecture\n",

  "description": "Any team developing and maintaining software - be it free and open\nsource or commercial - employs one form of software testing or another.\nBut what are the different kinds of tests in our tool boxes? And how are\nthey best used? In this talk we'll take a look around and try to answer\nthese questions.\n\nFirst, we'll examine the basic concepts of testing: Everyone has\nprobably at least heard about *unit tests* , but are they all you need?\n*Performance tests* can help you find out how well your product performs\nunder load and detect bottle necks early on. *Manual testing* is often\nlooked down upon, since it's not automated, but is it always a bad idea?\nAnd what even *is* *mutation testing*?\n\nWe'll also get to know a lot of the amazing testing tools from the\nPython ecosystem. Find out what the best test runner is (Spoiler alert:\nit's pytest). Learn how to make writing test more fun and less work\nusing tools like mock, Faker and factory\\_boy. Measure the quality of\nyour test suite using coverage.py.\n\nBut no tool is the right one for any situation. We'll also talk about\nwhen and how to use each of the tools, while debunking common\nmisconceptions and demonstrating best practices.\n",
