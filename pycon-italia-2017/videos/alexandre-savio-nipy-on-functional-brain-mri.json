  "description": "Have you seen the Kaggle competition on brain functional MRI (fMRI)? It\nwas called: `MLSP 2014 Schizophrenia Classification\nChallenge <https://www.kaggle.com/c/mlsp-2014-mri>`__. The number of\npublic databases of neuroimaging data is increasing and with them, the\nnumber of scientific open questions regarding its pre- and\npost-processing.\n\nThey offered 2 types of features: Functional Network Connectivity (FNC)\nand Source-Based Morphometry (SBM) loadings. These features are obtained\nthrough a pre-processing pipeline that can be rather complex and still\npresents many open scientific questions.\n\nI will show in this talk some tools on how to deal with this type of\ndata, how to use Python to do most of the pre-processing of one\nsubject\u2019s fMRI data, and one way to create a functional connectivity\nmatrix.\n\nYou can also find the slides\n`here <https://github.com/alexsavio/pydata2017-florence-talk>`__\n",
