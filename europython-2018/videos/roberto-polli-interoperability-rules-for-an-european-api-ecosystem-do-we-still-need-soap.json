  "description": "Intro\n-----\n\nItaly is introducing a new API Ecosystem because the complexity of the\nold SOAP-based protocol was now a barrier for the creation of newer\nservices.\n\nThis talk presents the Digital Transformation Team ongoing work on an\ninteroperability framework based on (REST) API, including:\n\n-  the scheme standardization based on EU standards, ontologies and RFC\n-  an availability strategy based on a distributed circuit-breaker and\n   throttling patterns\n-  a contract-first (API-first) approach to REST services via `OpenAPI\n   spec <https://www.openapis.org/>`__\n\nChallenges\n----------\n\n-  when you can replace SOAP Headers with the HTTP semantics introduced\n   in RFC 7230-7238\n-  strategies for a non-repudiation system based on HTTP (eg. DOSETA,\n   JWS, ..)\n-  the path towards an European interoperable API Ecosystem\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\n-  basic knowledge of SOAP, REST and the HTTP protocol\n-  general web service issues, DDOS, availability and metrics\n",
