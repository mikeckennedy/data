  "description": "Take incredible snaps of the wildlife in your garden or school\n\nI was annoyed and frustrated with the cost of setting up a video stream\nof nature at school. It can be a couple of hundred pounds to set up a\nlive bird box. A wonderful resource but can be prohibitively expensive\nfor schools, so I had a go at doing it myself. I decided to set up some\ncamera traps using a few Raspberry Pi computers and I was really amazed\nat how easy it was and how brilliant the results where. It turns out I\nhave badgers at the bottom of my garden! I now have several set up\nincluding an auto tweeting camera on a bird feeder (@pibirdbrain) and a\nfew at school including a pond cam where we've managed to get some\nreally great and close up pics of tadpoles and newts.\n\nI want to show others how easy it is to get going (you don't need to be\nan expert), that it's really cheap and fantastic fun.",
