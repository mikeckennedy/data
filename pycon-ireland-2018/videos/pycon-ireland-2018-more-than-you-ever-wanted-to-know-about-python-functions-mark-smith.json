  "description": "What exactly are functions? Let's talk about functions, methods, callables and closures - what they are, what you can give them, what they can give you, what you can do with them ... and what's inside. You probably think you already know everything about functions, but you probably don't! By the end of this talk, I guarantee you'll know more about callables than when you walked in, along with techniques both practical and so extreme your colleagues will never let you merge them to master. (This guarantee is legally non-binding and cannot be redeemed in any way.)",
