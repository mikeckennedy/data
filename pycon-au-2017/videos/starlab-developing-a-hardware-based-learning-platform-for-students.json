  "description": "The team at Obelisk Systems have developed a hardware coding platform with a companion online learning platform that introduces students to coding with Python and programming hardware. Unique features of the StarLAB platform allow multiple students to wirelessly connect to and run code on the StarLAB platform simultaneously, helping develop teamwork skills while not requiring students to huddle around a computer. We have partnered with the ME program to develop a series of courses available in an online platform to develop coding skills while meeting the outcomes of the BOSTES approved iSTEM curriculum. Students coding skills will be tested at the end of the year with a national Mars Rover Challenge.",
