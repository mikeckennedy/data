  "description": "\"Practical AI: Computer Vision\" by: Maxwell Ogunfunwa\n\nIn this current era of the internet, much of our knowledge transfer is happening via multimedia formats namely images. As a result, computer vision has blossomed, becoming the front runner in the race to actualizing artificial intelligence. In the past 5 years many state-of-the-art models have been created making computer vision more accessible to businesses.\n\nIn this talk, I will explain how a modern business model can quickly adapt to these changing times and utilize computer vision to enhance their digital assets.   \n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
