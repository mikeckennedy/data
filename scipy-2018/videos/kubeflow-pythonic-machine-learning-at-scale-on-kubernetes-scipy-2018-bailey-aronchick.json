  "description": "\u201cKubeFlow marks the beginning of the end of the data scientist and/or\nsoftware engineer as disparate roles. Like DevOps has merged operations\nand development, DataDevOps will consume data science.\u201d - Philip Winder,\nan engineer and consultant at Container Solutions http://container-\nsolutions.com/tensorflow-on-kubernetes-kubeflow/ You've created and\ntuned a machine learning model, using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or\nscikit-learn - now what? How can you ensure that the model is deployed\nto your DevOps team as production-ready code, and can scale as needed on\nincoming data? How can you seamlessly migrate a model from your local\nlaptop / virtual machine to a hosted server on your cloud platform of\nchoice? This talk walks through the architecture of Kubeflow: a project\ndedicated to answering those questions - and to making machine learning\non Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. We will describe, in\ndetail, the three components of the project: \\* a JupyterHub platform\nfor creating and managing Jupyter notebook servers that are used by data\nscience and research groups; \\* a Tensorflow Customer Resource for\nmanaging compute resources to a specific cluster size; and \\* a\nTensorflow Serving container to house the machine learning work. By the\nend of this talk, you will have a firm understanding of why Kubernetes\nwould be useful to machine learning engineers, and how you can deploy\nit, today, to support your predictive models.\nhttps://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflowPresenter(s): Speaker: Paige Bailey,\nMicrosoft Speaker: David Aronchick, Google\n",
