  "description": "Publicly funded fire departments are critical to our society. We rely on\nthem for fire prevention and fighting, and their influence has shaped\nour cities for centuries. It's time the software industry learned from\nhistory and created a public service of our own.\n\nThe history of fire companies dates back millennia, but their current\nform is relatively new, just a few hundred years old. The evolution of\nthese companies happened in parallel in different nations, but I\u2019d like\nto tell the story of how London\u2019s fire brigades became the public\nservice we know today. We'll look at how fire departments have evolved\nstarting with the Roman Empire all the way through the formation of the\nfirst publicly funded fire brigades in London. By the end, I hope to\nconvince you that we need an Internet emergency service and that we\nshould take a shortcut to get there.\n",
