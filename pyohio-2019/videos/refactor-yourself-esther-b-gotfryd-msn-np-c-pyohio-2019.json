  "description": "Do you sometimes feel like a pile of legacy code? Do you dread\nrefactoring yourself into a \"new hotness,\u201d due to the insurmountable\namount of work it may take? Do you want to break free, but are unsure of\nwhere to start? Look no further, as this session will embark on a\njourney to refactor you, one red- green test at a time, starting with\nthe highest priority issues first.\n\nWe all have been there (or witnessed it in someone else): glassy-eyed,\nglaring into many open screens, fingers rushing through multiple lines\nof code, energy drink of some sort by your side, and possibly snacks\nthat were dug out of the pantry (which should have been disposed of long\nago). You are now propelled into a sleepless night \u2014 and hopefully,\nvictory by the time the sun comes up. As you sit there trying to solve\nyet another complex problem, you become keenly aware of the fuzzy\nsensation in your brain, the fatigue in your body, the somewhat weird\nnoises in your stomach, and your general lack of capacity to process\nwhat it is you came here to do. In this talk, we will walk through\nconcepts of sleep hygiene, eating habits, digestive concerns, body\naches, strains, and pains, mood concerns, and how they all affect your\nability to function. We will discuss how to examine your recent\nbehavior, prioritize any symptoms, what to tackle first, and how to\npersevere in the long run.\n",
