  "abstract": "Commercial machine learning projects are currently like start-ups: many\nprojects fail, but some are extremely successful, justifying the total\ninvestment. While some people will tell you to \"embrace failure\", I say\nfailure sucks --- so what can we do to fight it? In this talk, I will\ndiscuss how to address some of the most likely causes of failure for new\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) projects. My main recommendation is to\ntake an iterative approach: don't assume you know what your pipeline\nshould look like, let alone your annotation schemes or model\narchitectures. I will also discuss a few tips for figuring out what's\nlikely to work, along with a few common mistakes. To keep the advice\nwell-grounded, I will refer specifically to our open-source library\nspaCy, and our commercial annotation tool Prodigy.\n",
