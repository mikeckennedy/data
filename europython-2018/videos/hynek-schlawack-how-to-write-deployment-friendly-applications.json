  "description": "The DevOps movement gave us many ways to put Python applications into\nproduction. But should your application care? Should it need to know\nwhether it\u2019s running on your notebook, on a server, in a Docker\ncontainer, or in some cloud platform as a service?\n\nIt should not, because environment-agnostic applications are easier to\ntest, easier to deploy, easier to handle, and easier to scale.\n\nBut how can you practically structure and configure your applications to\nmake them indifferent to the environment they run in? How do secrets fit\ninto the picture? And where do you put that log file?\n\nBy the end of this talk you\u2019ll know the tools and techniques that enable\nyou to write such Python applications and you\u2019ll be ready for the next\nbig change.\n",
