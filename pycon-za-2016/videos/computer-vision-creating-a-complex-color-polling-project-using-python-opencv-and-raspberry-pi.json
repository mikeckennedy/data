  "description": "I will be talking about creating a computer vision classroom color poll\nsheet recognition project using Python, OpenCV and raspberry Pi.\nSpecifically, looking at detecting color poll-sheets in a classroom of\nabout 50 - 150 students. Much like how one can poll an audience of\npeople using a clicker technology and show the results of the audience\nwith regards to a question asked.\n\n-  Audience is anyone interested in computer vision, what computer\n   vision can do and achieve, as well as the hard work required to make\n   it all happen.\n\n-  After the talk the audience can have a glimpse into what it takes to\n   create a computer vision project, as well as the typical process and\n   algorithm one would follow in a simple task of creating a computer\n   vision project using python, opencv and raspberry pi.\n\n-  A few aspects I will cover include:\n\n   - Computer vision goals \n   - Simplified overview of the algorithm used \n   - Going into a bit of detail where the challenges arise \n   - Example of the the project i worked on \n   - Results achieved \n   - A few global interesting projects around computer vision\n\nI will end with a look into the python code involved and talk through\nthe results of the polling program, as well as any hard to detect areas\nand how the system detects these. :)\n",
