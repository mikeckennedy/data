  "description": "Open-sourced and inner-sourced projects often struggle to get\nengagement. Communities, such as Github and PyPi, are host to\nredundant projects and libraries. In the development space, how do\nyou distinguish your project from others, get people excited to\ncontribute to it, and ultimately create a successful open source\nproject? The answer is to apply user-centered design techniques to\nthe development of your project. User-centered design is usually\napplied to web applications and products on the front-end of a\nwebsite, but these techniques can be applied to open source\nlibraries. In user-centered open source projects, your users are\nthose who type `pip install $your_library`. In this talk, Jackie will\nillustrate some user-centered techniques that have been used on her\nown project - Mesa (https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa), along with\nother successful open source projects.",
