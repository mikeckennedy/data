  "description": "Day 2, R0 10:50\u201311:35\n\nWhat would it be if the computer could accompany human automatically? \r\n\r\nAutomatic accompaniment is a research topic which is proposed 35 years ago. Nowadays, this is still a very attractive topic. e.g. a musician plays the main melody of \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\"; the computer performs the accompaniment part adapt for the musician's tempo. That is to say, the system must be able to \"listen to\" musician in real-time.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will share the topic background, problem definition, the approaches I tried, and show the accompaniment result with a performer.\r\n\r\nAs an entry-level session, everyone is welcome to attend. It will be better if you are interested in music tech.\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\n\nSpeaker: \u8303\u65af\u8d8a Szu-Yueh Fan\n\nSzu-Yueh pursues theory and engineering balanced lifestyle. \r\n\r\nHe embraces complexity and uncertainty that is why he likes the probabilistic model more than the deterministic model.\r\nHe loves to be a creator that is why the generative model is more interesting to him than the discriminative model. \r\n\r\nAmateur book translator, tech+music enthusiast, cellist.",
