  "description": "This talk will explain the thread-per-core data architecture of Scylla and\r\ndetail how we implemented \"shard-awareness\" in the Cassandra Python driver\r\nwhich allows to route queries down to the right CPU!\r\n\r\nCassandra's and Scylla's architecture and topology rely on the usage of\r\na consistent token ring to distribute their data evenly on the cluster.\r\n\r\nThe cassandra-python driver is used widely to interact with those NoSQL\r\ndatabases. It implements connection pools and token awareness allowing the\r\ndriver to route queries to the right node based on its knowledge of where the\r\ndata is.\r\n\r\nBut Scylla goes one step further as it also dedicates CPUs to a smaller portion\r\nof the data on each node (called shards). This means that **we can route CQL\r\nqueries not only to the right node but to the right CPU**!\r\n\r\nThis talk will give implementation details on how we have done it.\r\n\r\nTalk audience requirements: having a minimal knowledge of what Cassandra and\r\na consistent hash ring are.",
