  "description": "In July of 2018, Guido van Rossum stepped down as \u201cBenevolent Dictator\nfor Life\u201d of Python. In December, Python core developers voted on a new\ngovernance structure to guide Python going forward. This talk explores\nwhat\u2019s changing and how it may impact the Python community.\n\nBased on analysis of the relevant PEPs and other documentation, and\nstrengthened via a series of interviews with core developers and other\ncommunity leaders, we\u2019ll cover Python governance past, present and\nfuture. Particular care will be taken to explain why the core developers\nchose the governance model they did, what the new system entails, and\nhow community members can participate in it.\n",
