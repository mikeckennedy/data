  "description": "The goal is that our Data Science projects should add value to our business. If they never make it to production or never find users this can\u2019t happen. Projects often get blocked due to lack of commitment from other teams in the org. This talk will step through a computer vision project development and focus on how to keep engagement and excitement.",
