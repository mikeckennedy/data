  "description": "According to the always trustworthy Wikipedia, there are approximately 360\nmillion native English speakers in the world. We, as developers, are so used\nto write code and documentation in English that we may not realize that this\nnumber only represents 4.67% of the world population. It is very useful to\nhave a common language for the communication between developers, but this\ndoesn\u2019t mean that the user shouldn\u2019t feel a little bit more comfortable when\nusing your product.\n\nTranslation of terms is only one step in the whole Internationalization\n(i18n) and Localization (l10n) process. It also entails number, date and\ntime formatting, currency conversion, sorting, legal requirements, among\nother issues. This talk will go through the definition of i18n and l10n as\nwell as show the main tools available for developers to support multiple\nlanguages and regional related preferences in their Python program. We will\nalso see how one can enable local support for their website in Django.\nFinally, this presentation will discuss how we can manage\nInternationalization and Localization for a bigger product running in\ndifferent platforms (front and back end) and how to incorporate i18n and\nl10n into our current development and deploy processes.\n\nOh, and by the way, \u201ceita!\u201d is a Brazilian interjection to show yourself\nsurprised with something.",
