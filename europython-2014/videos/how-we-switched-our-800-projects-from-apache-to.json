  "description": "The talk will start from describing the setup we had for the last 7\nyears, i.e. Apache with mod\\_wsgi for Python projects and mod\\_php4/5\nfor PHP projects + nginx. I will explain why we used this setup for so\nlong time, what problems we faced with this setup and what solutions we\ntried to solve them before switching to uWSGI.\n\nThen I will tell about uWSGI, what it is, how it works and what features\nit has. I will show the comparison of configuration files, how simple it\nis to configure uWSGI compared to Apache.\n\nLastly I will explain how we managed to switch all our 800+ projects\ndeveloped over the years in 2 different languages with 2 major versions\nchanged (PHP4/5 and Python2/3), how this switch simplified our\ndevelopment and administration of this projects, the improvements we got\nin memory management and other areas.\n\nOf course I will concentrate mainly on our Python projects because it is\nEuroPython after all and not EuroPHP ;-)\n",
