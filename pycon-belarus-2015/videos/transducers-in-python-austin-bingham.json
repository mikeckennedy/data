  "description": "Understanding Transducers Through Python \u2013 Transducers are a new and\ninteresting functional programming concept that comes from the world of\nClojure. In this talk we\u2019ll learn about transducers by seeing how to\nimplement them in Python. By using transducers to build familiar\nfunctional programming elements like map and filter, we\u2019ll see that\ntransducers are actually simple, elegant, and quite powerful.\n",
