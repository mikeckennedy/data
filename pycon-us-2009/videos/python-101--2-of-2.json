  "description": "Python 101 (Part 2 of 2)\n\nThis half-day tutorial presents the basics of Python to beginning and\nintermediate programmers. It pairs well with Python 102 which follows a\nsimilar outline but goes much deeper. Rather than starting with \"Hello,\nworld!\", we use the interactive Python interpreter to get hands-on\nfamiliarity with much of core Python before covering blocks and scripts.\nThe tutorial is divided into short sections, each with presentation and\nexercises, to quickly cover lots of ground. Advanced topics are\nintroduced throughout and covered in \"extra credit\" exercises such that\nmore advanced participants can learn at their own pace.\n",
