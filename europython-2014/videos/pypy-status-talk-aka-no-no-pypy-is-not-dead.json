  "description": "In this talk we will present the current status of PyPy, with a\nparticular focus on what happened in the last two years, since the last\nEuroPython PyPy talk. We will give an overview of the current speed and\nthe on-going development efforts, including but not limited to:\n\n-  the status of the Just-in-Time Compiler (JIT) and PyPy performance in\n   general;\n-  the improvements on the Garbage Collector (GC);\n-  the status of the NumPy and Python 3 compatibility subprojects;\n-  CFFI, which aims to be a general C interface mechanism for both\n   CPython and PyPy;\n-  a quick overview of the STM (Software Transactional Memory) research\n   project, which aims at solving the GIL problem.\n\nThis is the \"general PyPy status talk\" that we give every year at\nEuroPython (except last year; hence the \"no no, PyPy is not dead\" part\nof the title of this talk).\n",
