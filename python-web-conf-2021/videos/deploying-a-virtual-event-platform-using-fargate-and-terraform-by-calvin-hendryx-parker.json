  "description": "\"Deploying a Virtual Event Platform Using Fargate and Terraform\" by: Calvin Hendryx-Parker\n\nLearn to leverage cloud native tools and launch a scalable application into the Cloud with Fargate. We\u2019ll dive in with how to getting up and running fast, but leaving the overhead of managing virtual machines and Kubernetes behind. Create and store the application Docker images in ECR and without touching the AWS console we can create fully Infrastructure as Code automated deployments via CodePipeline into Fargate containers and S3 buckets. Deliver the React application via CloudFront and S3 for full global scalability. Leave the legacy deployments behind and forge bravely into the new world of Cloud applications.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
