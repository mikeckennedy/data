  "description": "Grok or how Zope3 reinvented itself\n\nPresented by Roman Joost\n\nAbstract\n\nThe talk introduces how to quickly and easily create web applications\nwith Grok, a web framework based on Zope3 (http://grok.zope.org/).\n\nOutline\n\nGrok is a web application framework based on Zope 3 - the popular\napplication server. One of the main aspects of Grok is the rapid\ndevelopment of web applications without losing the flexibility Zope 3\nprovides. The talk covers a quick introduction to Zope 3 and Grok. Based\non an example, I will provide a quick walk through on how easy it is to\ncreate sophisticated web applications with Grok. Additionally, the talk\noutlines pitfalls for newcomers and how to avoid them.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n",
