  "description": "All developers have seen it and few will admit to doing it. Putting\nunprotected authentication credentials like usernames and passwords or\ncloud service authentication keys into application code, scripts or\nAnsible playbooks. We do this because it saves us time and effort. Add\nin external source control tools, like Github, and the risks of these\ncredentials being publicly exposed increases. While most developers\nagree on the importance of automated testing and syntax checking, its\ntime to add protecting application secrets, to the list of best\npractices. In this talk, we will explore how to use Hashicorp Vault, a\nsecure storage and encryption tool, to help manage authentication in a\nway that is safe and secure. Time will be spent on learning how to setup\na Vault server, migrate secrets into the service, and modify python\nscripts and Ansible playbooks to take advantage of Vault. This talk is\nfor developers of all levels who are interested in a better way to\nmanage their secrets and become the next hero with their security\ndepartment. (Your results may vary.) Presenter has no affiliation with\nHashicorp.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1657\n\nin \\_\\_on **Sunday 5 May** at 09:45 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
