  "description": "Deepfakes has caused a huge stir over the past few years. **Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs)** are the cause of it all. GANs are a type of\n**deep neural network** that can generate new data. GANs comprise of two\ncompeting networks and the results, especially in creating new images are\ntruly astounding.\n\nThis talk will introduce deep learning and how GANs work, highlighting\napplication areas. Most importantly it will provide a **hands-on\nimplementation** of GANs using **Pytorch**. With the **tips and tricks**\nfrom this talk, you\u2019ll be ready to start experimenting with GANs!",
