  "description": "Day 2, R0 16:15\u201316:45\n\nNeural networks work in \"mysterious ways\", but we can now peer into some of them to see how they work. This talk focuses on a tool called Lucid, from the TensorFlow team, and aims to show some interesting examples of different ways of visualizing neural networks with the goal of improving explainability. You will come away with a bit more understanding of how neural networks \"learn\", and what aspects they are \"looking\" at.\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\n\nSpeaker: Yufeng Guo\n\nYufeng is a Developer Advocate focusing on Cloud AI, where he is working to make machine learning more understandable and usable for all.\r\nHe is the creator of the YouTube series AI Adventures, at yt.be/AIAdventures, exploring the art, science, and tools of machine learning.\r\nHe is enjoys hearing about new and interesting applications of machine learning, share your use case with him on Twitter @YufengG",
