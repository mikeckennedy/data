  "description": "\u201cWhat is Python?\u201d is a common phrase in Africa, especially when you try\nto advertise Python events. This is because Python is a relatively new\nprogramming language in most parts of Africa. In most countries where\nglobal companies like Google, Amazon and Oracle are absent, Python is\nrarely used as a programming language in businesses. Despite this, a\nnumber of Python enthusiasts from different parts of the globe have been\nworking so hard to promote the use of Python in Africa by setting up a\nvibrant community on the continent.\n\nIn my talk, I will share on the various Python initiatives taking place\nin some parts of the African continent and how they have advanced the\nuse of Python in Africa. I will also present the challenges faced by\ndevelopers in Africa in building their Python community. My talk will\nalso present the milestones that have been achieved so far in trying to\nadvance the use of Python in Africa. I will also share on the\nopportunities that Africa presents in terms of making an impact within\nthe Python community. I will conclude my talk by highlighting ways in\nwhich we can all make a difference in advancing the use and knowledge of\nPython in Africa.\n",
