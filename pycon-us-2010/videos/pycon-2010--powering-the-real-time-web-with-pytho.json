  "description": "Powering the real-time web with Python: PubSubHubbub on App Engine\n\nPresented by Brett Slatkin\n\nPubSubHubbub is an open protocol that turns Atom and RSS feeds into\nreal-time streams. I built the reference Hub run by Google using Python\nand App Engine. In this talk you will learn how I made the real-time\nsystem work: An intro to the protocol, asynchronous processing on App\nEngine, fault-tolerance, and scalability.\n\nFor details on PubSubHubbub and the Hub's source code, see\n`http://code.google\n.com/p/pubsubhubbub/ <http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/>`__.\n",
