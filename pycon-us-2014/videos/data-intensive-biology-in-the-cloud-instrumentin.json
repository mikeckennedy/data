  "summary": "Cloud computing offers some great opportunities for science, but most\ncloud computing platforms are I/O and memory limited, and hence are poor\nmatches for data-intensive computing. After 4 years of research software\ndevelopment we are now instrumenting and benchmarking our analysis\npipelines; numbers, lessons learned, and future plans will be discussed.\nEverything is open source.\n",
