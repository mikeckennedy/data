  "description": "Sponsor Talk- Dato\nThe future is one full of intelligence. Thanks to the practical application of machine learning, apps can now drive product recommendations, predict machine failures, forecast airfare, social match-make, identify fraud, predict disease outbreaks, and repurpose pharmaceuticals. These applications output real-time predictions and recommendations in response to user and machine input to directly create intelligent services and amazing experiences which result in tremendous business value. I\u2019ll share our mission at Dato to accelerate the development of intelligent applications. There will be code and demos.",
