  "description": "Although Python 3 is considered the future of Python, Python 2.x will\nbe maintained for several more years, alongside Python 3 which is not\nbackwards compatible with many open source projects and some packages\non PYPi still supporting python 2.x because the users of these\nprojects still use python 2.x.\n\nThis talk explains clean ways to write code that will run on both Python\n2.x and 3.x with examples of how to convert existing Python 2-compatible\ncode to code that will run reliably on both Python 2.x and 3.x.\n\nDevelopers working on either small, medium, or large projects will\nappreciate the explanations, detailed examples, and clean techniques to\nhelp them extend support for both versions to their existing Python\n2-compatible projects.\n\nThe talk will give insight into the content in the book `Python 2 and 3\nCompatibility <https://www.amazon.com/Python-Compatibility-Python-Future-Joannah-Nanjekye/dp/1484229541>`__\nthat will available in October but be released in paper backs in January\n2018 by Apress.\n",
