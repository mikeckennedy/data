But how we can keep a\nrecord of all the drafts of legislation that are happening right now?\nHow we can use this information and create an action for the public to\nshow their agreement or not for every change that happens.\n\nWith Scrapy, Python, Django, and Open source! Let me show you how has\nbeen done in Brazil and the Pipeline that makes possible to replicated\nhere in Italy!\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1702\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 3 May** at 10:30 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
