  "description": "Indico is an open source content management system developed at the\nEuropean Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and currently used in\nmore than 90 scientific institutions world-wide. Indico provides a\nmultitude of features to conference/meeting organizers, merging the\ncapabilities of a powerful CMS with a calendaring layer, thus allowing\nusers to keep track of past and future meetings, and to quickly access\nall the resources concerning a particular event. Other very useful\nfeatures include:\n\n-  Conference registration & e-payment integration;\n-  Paper/abstract reviewing;\n-  Integration with chat (XMPP) systems;\n-  Integration with videoconferencing/webcasting applications;\n-  Room booking module;\n-  Drag&drop; timetable editing;\n-  Event reminders & alarms (scheduler);\n-  Extensible via plugin subsystem;\n\nAt CERN alone, Indico serves a community of around 10.000 users, with\n~15.000 different visitors per day (~1 M hits). It hosts more than\n150.000 events, made of around 700.000 individual contributions/talks\nand ~900.000 files. It has become part of \"CERN speech\" - \"look it up on\nIndico\" is almost as obvious as \"Google it\" around here.\n\nBut Indico is as well an indispensable tool in the realm of High Energy\nPhysics, going far beyond the borders of this organization. Institutions\nsuch as Fermilab, MIT and IHEP (China) are using it for their own\nmeetings/conferences.\n\nThe system is fully written in Python and JavaScript, using ZODB as its\ndatabase back-end. It is a perfect example of how Python-related\ntechnologies can be used to build powerful web applications that empower\nscientific research and collaboration.\n",
