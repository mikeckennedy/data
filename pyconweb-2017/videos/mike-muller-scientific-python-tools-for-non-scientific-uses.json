  "description": "Python is an amazing programming language that is used by many different\ncommunities. Dev-ops, web programmers, sys admins, database programmers\nas well as scientists and engineers from many different fields use it daily.\nBut often members of one sub-community might not be familiar with the\nlibraries and tools another sub-community uses. Even these libraries are\noriginally designed for total different purposes, they can be useful for\nunintended usages.\n\nThis talk introduces two very use popular scientific Python tools, the Jupyter\nNotebook for fast, exploratory Python programming and pandas, the amazingly\nuseful data analyses library. Both libraries could be called killer apps in\ntheir fields. Come and see what they can offer and how they can simplify your\ndaily web-programming tasks.",
