  "description": "This talk will focus on the design, implementation and evaluation of an open source python ORM for redis : redact-py.\n\nIt will look at some reasons to use redis over other SQL and noSQL alternatives. Interesting properties such as atomicity, transactions and data structures and how these were translated to the ORM will also be discussed.\n\nJonathan is a developer at PageFair. He enjoys hacking on python, C and scala in his spare time and taking part in game jams.",
