  "description": "One of the nicest things about Python community, is the availability of\nmentors willing to help you. Various mentors have helped me navigate the\nopen source community and help advanced my skills. I realized finding a\nmentor is not as easy as it seems, and it takes a lot of courage to\nreach out in the first place. And then, there is impostor syndrome,\nwhere one may feel like they don\u2019t deserve the help.In this talk, I will\nprovide advice about working with mentor.Asking for help is not a\nfailure.\n",
