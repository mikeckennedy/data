  "description": "There is no doubt that open-source software plays an important role in the world of software development, ranging from the operating systems we use, to languages and libraries, to development tools, and everywhere in between. Yet, many software developers never consider contributing to the open-source software that they work with, not even when an obvious, direct opportunity presents itself. In this talk I'll try to make a case for why it's in your own interest, as a software developer, to get involved in open-source development, and give a few pointers to those who are interested, but just don't know where to start.",
