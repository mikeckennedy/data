  "description": "``Representative Agent' models in economics assume that differences across people (say, between poor and rich) do not matter for broad economic outcomes. Such models performed poorly in the Great Recession; but progress in``\\ heterogeneous\nagent' modeling has been held back because the tools for working with\nsuch models are primitive. The Econ-ARK/HARK project provides a\nPython-based set of tools that make it much easier to get started, and\nto make rapid progress, in handling the computational challenges of\ntaking account of the differences between agents (in preferences, in\nincomes, in beliefs) that matter for overall economic\noutcomes.Presenter(s): Speaker: Christopher Carroll, Johns Hopkins\nUniversity Speaker: Matthew White, University of Delaware\n",
