  "description": "Have you ever worked on embedded project? Chances are that you had to\nuse some proprietary IDE for development. Wouldn't it be better to\nuse some open source IDE like Eclipse or QtCreator? What should I do\nwhen I'm working a project and can't start from the scratch?\n\nIn this presentation I'll show you how Python can help you with\nporting projects. I'll give examples of projects developed in IAR\nEmbedded Workbench and Keil uVision. At the end we'll have CMake\nbuild file which can be imported to many IDEs.\n\nPython modules like Objectify and Jinja will be a great help to us!",
