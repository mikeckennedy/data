  "description": "This tutorial is a gentle introduction to Python for folks who are completely new to it and may not have much experience programming. We\u2019ll work in a Jupyter Notebook, one of the most popular tools in scientific Python. You\u2019ll learn how to write beautiful Python while practicing loops, if\u2019s, functions, and usage of Python\u2019s built-in features in a series of fun, interactive exercises. By the end of the tutorial we think you\u2019ll be ready to write your own basic Python -- but most importantly, we want you to learn the form and vocabulary of Python so that you can understand Python documentation and interpret code written by others. To continue learning more about Python as it\u2019s applied to data and science, join our companion tutorial titled Introduction to Scientific Python.",
