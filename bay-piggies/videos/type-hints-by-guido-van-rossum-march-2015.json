  "description": "Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python programming language, discusses type hinting in Python 3.5. \n\nWith type hinting, programmers can use type annotations to provide tools like type checkers and IDEs with more information about the expected types of values and enable better static analysis. To learn more about type hinting, check out PEP 484 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).\n\nThis talk was organized by the Bay Area Python Interest Group (\"BayPiggies\") and held at LinkedIn on March 26, 2015.
