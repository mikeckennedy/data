  "description": "This intermediate-level tutorial will provide students with hands-on\nexperience applying practical statistical modeling methods on real data.\nUnlike many introductory statistics courses, we will not be applying\n\"cookbook\" methods that are easy to teach, but often inapplicable;\ninstead, we will learn some foundational statistical methods that can be\napplied generally to a wide variety of problems: maximum likelihood,\nbootstrapping, linear regression, and other modern techniques. The\ntutorial will start with a short introduction on data manipulation and\ncleaning using `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__, before proceeding\non to simple concepts like fitting data to statistical distributions,\nand how to use Monte Carlo simulation for data analysis. Slightly more\nadvanced topics include bootstrapping (for estimating uncertainty around\nestimates) and flexible linear regression methods using Bayesian\nmethods. By using and modifying hand-coded implementations of these\ntechniques, students will gain an understanding of how each method\nworks. Students will come away with knowledge of how to deal with very\npractical statistical problems, such as how to deal with missing data,\nhow to check a statistical model for appropriateness, and how to\nproperly express the uncertainty in the quantities estimated by\nstatistical methods.\n",
