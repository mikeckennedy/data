  "description": "pyQuil is a Python-based, open-source quantum programming library.\npyQuil is part of the Rigetti Forest toolkit for programming and running\nquantum algorithms in the cloud on both a physical quantum computer and\nclassically- simulated quantum processor. Rigetti Computing is a\nstart-up in Berkeley, on a mission to build the first large-scale\ncommercial quantum computer. Recently we have demonstrated a hybrid\nclassical/quantum unsupervised machine learning algorithm on a 19-qubit\ngate model quantum processor.Presenter(s): Speaker: Guenevere\nPrawiroatmodjo, Rigetti Quantum Computing\n",
