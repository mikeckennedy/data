  "description": "At the present time, running sudo pip3 in Fedora is not safe. Pip shares its installation directory with DNF package manager, can remove DNF-managed files and generally break the Python 3 interpreter. \nIn this talk i'll try to describe the problem, possible solutions that have been discussed and the result of work which was proposed as a Fedora Change. I will also mention the process of discovering initialization of Python interpreter and I will show you a couple of live demos.",
