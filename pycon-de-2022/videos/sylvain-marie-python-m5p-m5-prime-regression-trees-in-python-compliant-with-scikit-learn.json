    "title": "`python-m5p` - M5 Prime regression trees in python, compliant with scikit-learn",
    "description": "Speaker:: Sylvain Mari\u00e9\n\nTrack: PyData: Machine Learning & Stats\nRegression trees are powerful Machine Learning models capable of both flexibility in modeling as well as interpretability when the tree is not too deep. The M5 algorithm, introduced by Quinlan in 1992 to provide more compact and smooth models for regression, was improved by Wang & Witten in 1997, under the name M5 Prime (acronym M5' or M5P). The algorithm gained popularity in particular a dozen years later with the Weka Machine Learning toolbox, providing a java-based implementation.\r\n\r\n`python-m5p` is an implementation of the M5P algorithm compliant with scikit-learn.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/8KXYBD\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
