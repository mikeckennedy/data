    "description": "Day 1,  13:05-13:35\n\nAbstract\n\nCyber forensics is a field that deals with the investigation of digital crimes by analyzing, examining, identifying, and recovering digital evidence from electronic devices and producing them in the court of law. The talk begins with an introduction to digital forensics, the process of investigation, and the collection of evidence. Next, I will cover the various python modules and built-in functions required to build your first cyber forensic application. The modules covered in the discussion are pyscreenshot, Whoosh, PIL, hashlib, mutagen, pyPDF2, and pefile. Finally, I will demonstrate creating small cyber forensic applications using bulit-in modules and functions that are already to known to most of the Python programmers.\n\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\nHackMD: https://hackmd.io/@pycontw/2021/%2F%40pycontw%2FByfYqeKGt\n\nSpeaker: Gajendra Deshpande\n\nMr. Gajendra Deshpande holds a masters degree in Computer Science and Engineering and working as Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, KLS Gogte Institute of Technology, Belagavi, Karnataka, India.
