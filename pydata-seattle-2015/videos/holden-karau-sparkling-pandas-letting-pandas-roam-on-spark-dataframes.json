PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark that is designed to scale to huge amounts of data but lacks the natural expressiveness of Pandas. This talk introduces Sparkling Pandas, a library that brings together the best features of Pandas and PySpark; Expressiveness, speed, and scalability.\n\nWhile both Spark 1.3 and Pandas have classes named \u2018DataFrame\u2019 the Pandas DataFrame API is broader and not fully covered by the \u2018DataFrame\u2019 class in Spark. This talk will explore some of the differences between Spark\u2019s DataFrames and Panda\u2019s DataFrames and then examine some of the work done to implement Panda\u2019s like DataFrames on top of Spark. In some cases, providing Pandas like functionality is computationally expensive in a distributed environment, and we will explore some techniques to minimize this cost.\n\nAt the end of this talk you should have a better understanding of both Sparkling Pandas and Spark\u2019s own DataFrames. Whether you end up using Sparkling Pandas or Spark directly, you will have a greater understanding of how to work with structured data in a distributed context using Apache Spark and familiar DataFrame APIs.\n\nMaterials available here:\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/hkarau/sparkling-pandas-electric-bugaloo-py-data-seattle-2015 \nProject github: https://github.com/sparklingpandas/sparklingpandas \nProject website: http://sparklingpandas.com/",
