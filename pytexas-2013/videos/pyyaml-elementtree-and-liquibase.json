  "description": "This talk will cover two libraries:\n\n* xml.etree.ElementTree - part of the standard library for parsing, manipulating, or generating XML\n* PyYAML - for parsing or generating YAML (and JSON)\n\nWe will demonstrate the benefits of both libraries, and then demonstrate how the combination of the two allows writing YAML for situations where hand-generated XML is required but tedious. The practical example is Liquibase, a product that uses user-generated XML to make gradual changes to database schema.",
