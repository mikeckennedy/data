  "abstract": "This talk is an update on Full Fact's keynote at last year's PyData\nLondon. I will describe the steps involved in producing a factcheck and\nwhich of them can be automated. Transfer learning technique called\nInferSent is really useful in solving this problem.\n\nThe first step in automating a factchecking workflow is to extract the\nsentences containing claims from the rest of the text. The percentage of\nverifiable claims among all the spoken sentences varies greatly between\npolitical programmes - from 32% during Parliamentary Prime Minister\u2019s\nquestions to 8% in political interviews in The Sunday Politics show.\nBeing able to detect them efficiently saves a lot of time for a\nfact-checker as it filters out most of the text.\n\nThere are a lot of models for encoding the meaning of a word in a word\nembedding but very few models for sentences. Popular solutions are naive\naveraging of word embeddings and doc2vec.\n\nI would like to discuss a new neural sentence embedding InferSent from\nFacebook. https://github.com/facebookresearch/InferSent\n\nIt is originally designed to detect if two sentences imply or contradict\neach other but also works quite well for sentence classification task.\n\nThe annotations to train the model were collected using a closed-source\nPython annotation tool Prodigy which I will briefly touch on as well.\n",

  "description": "There are a lot of models for individual word embeddings but few that\nencode the meaning of the whole sentence. i will introduce InferSent\nembedding for deciding if one sentence infers another. I will apply it\nto detecting factual claim sentence in text. It's the first step in\nautomating a fact-checking process at Full Fact as only 15% of political\nTV subtitles contain verfiable claims.\n",
