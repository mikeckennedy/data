Its value is in generating large quantities of similar but not identical assets such as textures and models. This talk will cover the topic of using procedural generation to create a landscape, which will give an illustration of the strengths of procedural generation and ways to overcome its weaknesses.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the topics covered are:\r\n- using layered opensimplex noise to create a heightmap, as well as an overview of types of noise and the shortcomings of purely noise-based terrain\r\n- using image processing techniques to add mountain ranges in a manner more consistent with real-world geography than noise alone would allow\r\n- further enhancing the terrain by converting it from a heightmap to voxels, and then applying an erosion simulation\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 13:35:00 2020 at Floperator",
