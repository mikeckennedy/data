  "description": "Mixins enable code re-usage across class hierarchies, adapters allow for\nadditional run-time behaviour \u2014 metachao aspects merge these two concept\nand go beyond: they can be applied to classes, instances and aspects\nthemselves, allowing for functional meta-programming in python. Their\nbeauty will be demonstrated by example of dictionary trees, where all\nbehaviour is implemented in form of aspects and applied to different\ndictionary implementations. The goal of the talk is to get an\nunderstanding of how aspect oriented programming can look and why\ndictionary trees in combination with aspects are a cool way of designing\napplications.\n",
