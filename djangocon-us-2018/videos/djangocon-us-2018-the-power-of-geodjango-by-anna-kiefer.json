  "description": "GeoDjango is Django\u2019s robust geographic Web framework to build GIS\napplications and handle geospatial data. It relies on PostGIS\n(PostgreSQL\u2019s database for geospatial objects) and the Python library\nGDAL. This talk will discuss how GeoDjango uses these to extend Django\nmodels to handle complex geometries and geographic queries. This talk is\nintended for software developers and those interested in mapping\nlocation data. There will be a short demonstration on how GeoDjango\nworks with popular mapping frameworks like Leaflet and OpenStreetMaps.\nWe will create a GeoDjango model, seed our PostGIS database using raw\nlocation data, and make a simple route and view so we can actually\nvisualize some data on a Leaflet map. We will also discuss the\ndifference between raster and vector data, geos geometries and geojson,\nand spatial reference systems.\n",
