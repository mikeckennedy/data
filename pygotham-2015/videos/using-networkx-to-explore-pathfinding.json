  "description": "In this talk we're going to cover using networkx to build a graph and\nthen use various networkx algorithms to find characteristics about that\npath. We will cover: - Introduction to Graphing and Pathfinding - Where\nto find other materials including Pycon 2015 conference materials and\nwebsites with simulations - Creating a graph, creating static layout,\ndisplaying nodes and edge value - Using networkx for pathfinding\nspecifically: dijkstra\\_path and astar\\_path - We'll go thru the\nalgorithm used for dijkstra and astar (A*) - Quick discussion of new\ntrends in path Finding: IDA*, theta\\* and phi\\* and Ant Colony\nOptimization algorithm Slides and code *will* be available on Github\n",
