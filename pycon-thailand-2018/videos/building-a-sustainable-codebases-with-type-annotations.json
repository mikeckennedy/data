  "description": "Maintaining large and fast-growing codebase is always hard. Especially on dynamic type language like Python. The good news is Python is now offering type annotations and it will help you understand your code more easily.\nIn this talk, We'll introduce you to the new syntax of type annotations and the tooling around type annotations ecosystem which will make your development workflow more productive. We'll share our experience on how we embrace type annotation to our development team and also some common pitfalls you might want to avoid.\n\n\n\n--------\n\nYothin is a Pythonista at Pronto Tools.
