  "description": "Mainstream software testing is terrible, because the tools to make it\ngood are missing.\n`Hypothesis <http://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ is a\ntesting library that aims to fix this.\n\nWhere classically unit testing requires you to think of all the edge\ncases yourself, Hypothesis actively seeks them out for you. Instead of\nlaboriously setting up examples where your code should work, you tell it\nhow your code should always work and it finds the examples that prove\nyou wrong.\n\nThis is a talk from the author of Hypothesis on the how, why and where\nof using it.\n\nThis talk presupposes you have at least a little bit of experience with\ntesting in Python, but familiarity with advanced topics is not required.",
