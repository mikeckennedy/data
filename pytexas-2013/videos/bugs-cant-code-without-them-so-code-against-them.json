  "description": "Over the last 10 years, Luke Lee has professionally written software for applications ranging from Python desktop and web applications to embedded C drivers for Solid State Disks. Currently, he writes scientific Python applications for Blueback Reservoir in Houston, TX. His enthusiasm for Python is emphasized throughout his presentations at several Python related conferences including Pycon, PyTexas, and PyArkansas. He is also an active member of the Houston Django and Python user groups.\n\n\nThere are a lot of approaches and philosophies to prevent bugs in software, but\nthe truth is they are unavoidable in complex, modern systems. So, what's a\ndeveloper to do? Code in a style that tries to alert and test for the bugs\nwhen they happen instead of feeling like a failure when you can't prevent the\nunavoidable.\n\nWikipedia defines this style of programming as 'defensive programming,' and the\nidea is code in a way that expects software to be misused and have bugs. This\ntalk will explore this general concept and how to add bits of this style of\ndevelopment to you Python code with the following:\n\n - Asserts\n - Logging\n - Unit tests",
