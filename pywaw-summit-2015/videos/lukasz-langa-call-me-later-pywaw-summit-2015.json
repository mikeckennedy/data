  "description": "Talk: Call Me Later\n\nasyncio is the reason to switch to Python 3 now. There, I said it. Is this used in production at Facebook? It is. On how many machines? On all of them. Why? It makes concurrent code easier to read. Easier to test. Sometimes even faster to run.If the words \"event loop\", \"coroutine\", \"yield from\", \"executor\" or \"future\" make you feel uneasy, come learn how beautiful and easy to understand it actually is at the core. No prior asyncore, Twisted or Node.js experience required.\n\nSpeaker: \u0141ukasz Langa. Python committer since 2010. Chronic perfectionist. Pianist. Dad. In his free time uses Python 3 to help Facebook maintain cache consistency.\n\nSlides: http://fb.me/call-me-later\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
