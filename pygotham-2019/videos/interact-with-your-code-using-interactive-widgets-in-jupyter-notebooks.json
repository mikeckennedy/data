  "description": "One of the most important parts of a data scientist\u2019s job is to be able to\nvisualize and get insights from data. What if there was a simpler way to\nexplore data? What if we could change input variables simply by sliding a\nmouse or we could control the degree of the polynomial by selecting from a\ndrop-down menu, and then see the output change instantaneously? This would\nallow data scientists to quickly prototype their ideas. Interactive widgets\nin Jupyter Notebooks allow one to do exactly that. The interact function\n(ipywidgets.interact) automatically creates user interface controls to\nexplore code and data interactively. In this talk, I will highlight the\npowerful capabilities that widgets and interactive functions provide, and\nhow one can efficiently leverage them to build interactive Jupyter\nNotebooks.",
