Join us in this interactive session as we hear from three popular authors about their experiences publishing a book from start to finish. We\u2019ll be joined by Al Sweigart, who\u2019s most popular book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python has been met with rave reviews, April Speight, author of Bite-Size Python and Harry Percival who authored Test Driven Development with Python. They\u2019ll clue you in on what the process is like from start to finish, tips on how to get started if you\u2019d like to write your own book, and warn you of unexpected pitfalls.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycascades-2021/talk/QCRVPL/\n\nAfter three amazing in-person conferences, this time we're moving PyCascades online.\r\n\r\nPyCascades is a regional PyCon in the Pacific Northwest, celebrating the west coast Python developer and user community.
