  "description": "In this talk and technical demo we\u2019re going to walk through a minimal example Django web app, simulate traffic of varied intensity, and monitor the entire system as well as peek deeper in the app.\nIt is 3am. Your phone rings with a special tone - the systems propping up your employer\u2019s or client\u2019s website are down. You open your eyes and groan, fumbling for your laptop. You\u2019re used to the system\u2019s worst problems, you have an idea what it might be. It\u2019s slow going while you manually check if every component is working. You go back to bed in an hour, having written up a few of the most important details and brought the website back up. Hooray!\nHowever, at 6am you get another call. You sigh and fix it. Then another at 7am, and at 11am. A few days later the outages repeat. What is going on?!\nThere are types of problems that can\u2019t be solved purely through experience and knowledge of a system. You need deeper monitoring data than \u201c% CPU\u201d and \u201cRAM free\u201d to resolve them. Worse still, there are multiple components involved with failures in one masking a true underlying cause in another, like a slow loading page masking a slow database, which in turn makes you wonder what queries it\u2019s really answering. In this talk we\u2019re going to have a look at how you can monitor small to medium projects to really understand deeper problems at a glance.\nThe talk will pick specific solutions from various vendors as well as open source for different parts of the problem.\n",
