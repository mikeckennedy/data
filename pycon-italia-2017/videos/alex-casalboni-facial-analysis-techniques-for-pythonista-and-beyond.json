  "description": "The ability to detect, track, and analyze faces opens up a wide range of\ninteresting use cases, ranging from interactive smart applications and\nreal- time video processing, all the way to biometric security and\naugmented reality.\n\nThis talk will showcase the available **tools built by the Python\ncommunity** and their corresponding pros & cons, limitations, and\ncomplexity. While discussing the possible scenarios and what is actually\nrequired to **DIY with Python**, I will compare such handmade solutions\nwith **Cloud-based products and APIs**.\n\n**Prerequisites**: basic understanding of Python\u2019s data science stack\n(especially numpy).\n",
