  "description": "This time it\u2019ll be different. It\u2019s a green field project and you\u2019ve\nlearned from your mistakes. You\u2019re not going to make the same ones\nagain.\n\nFast forward several months and you\u2019re in a mess. A change in one place\ncauses bugs in a completely different place. Adding a simple feature\nmeans making changes all over your application. Progress is getting\nslower and slower. You\u2019re lost in complexity.\n\nWhy does this keep happening and what can we do about it?\n\nThis talk will try to answer those questions.\n\nI\u2019ll show how complex software really is, define the different types of\ncomplexity found in software, explain the issues complexity causes and\ndiscuss different techniques we can use to manage it.\n\nThis talk is suitable for anyone who has worked or will work on a\nsoftware development project. No development experience is required.\n",
