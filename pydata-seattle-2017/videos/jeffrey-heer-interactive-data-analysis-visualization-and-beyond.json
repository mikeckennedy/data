  "description": "Data analysis is a complex process with frequent shifts among data formats, tools and models, as well as between symbolic and visual thinking. How might the design of improved tools accelerate people's exploration and understanding of data? Covering both interactive demos and principles from academic research, my talk will examine how to craft a careful balance of interactive and automated methods, combining concepts from data visualization, machine learning, and computer systems to design novel interactive analysis tools.",
