  "description": "This session is about the story of two girls who decided to make a clock\nthemselves after searching a lot on the internet and without finding\nwhat they were looking for.\n\nIn this talk we will tell you what we used and how we used it, we will\nalso tell you how we made plans and then how we made circuits (timing,\nrequirements, how difficult and fun it was)\n\nWe will finally tell you more about code and why exactly we wrote it\nlike that (Spoiler: there was a module with the RTC we used but the\nmemory of the trinket was to small to support the original code to do\nwhat exactly we wanted to do)\n",
