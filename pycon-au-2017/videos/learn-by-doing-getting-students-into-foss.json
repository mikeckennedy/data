  "description": "Getting students involved with free and open source projects is a great way to provide them with real world development experience while contributing to the common good, but making that first contribution is difficult even for students already confident in their skills. This is where the Google Open Source team\u2019s student programs, Google Summer of Code and Google Code-in, come into play.\n\nWe\u2019ve been partnering with open source projects for 12 years to provide students with structure, mentorship, and real world experience. Through participation in these programs, students learn how to work on existing codebases, communicate across timezones, run test suites, use version control systems, and ultimately end up making contributions that are nearly professional quality. \n\nIn this session I\u2019ll share more information about these programs and other opportunities for students to learn by doing in open source.",
