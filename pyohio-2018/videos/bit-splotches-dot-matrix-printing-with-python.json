  "description": "Earlier this year, in the spring of 2018, I bought a printer made in the\nlate 80's in the parking lot of a Rax Roast Beef restaurant for $20.\nThis started a nostalgic journey assisted by NumPy matrix slices and a\ncan of WD-40. This talk will cover how I used Python to overcome three\ndecades of history to get it printing again.\n",
