  "description": "Python 101 for the .NET Developer\n\nPresented by Sarah Dutkiewicz\n\nThe first part of the session will cover the basics of Python - its\nhistory, how its data structures compare to those we're familiar with in\nthe primary .NET languages, its strong and weak points, who's using it,\nand why you as a developer - both generally speaking and as a .NET\ndeveloper - should care about Python. The second part of the session\nwill get into the demos - starting with some basic Python scripts and\ngetting into IronPython scripts, if time allows. By the end of this\nsession, you'll have an idea of what Python is, why you should know it\nas a developer and specifically as a .NET developer, and how to get\nsetup and write a basic app in both Python and IronPython.\n",
