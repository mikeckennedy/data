  "description": "New technologies like Docker, Kubernetes and Openshift make it much easier to run python applications on multiple servers for redundancy and load-balancing. In this talk I will explain how the 100% open-source Docker, Kubernetes and Openshift work and how to run python applications on this stack. I will show two or more live examples how to combine them with Git into a complete continuous delivery pipeline.\n\nTalk recorded at the Swiss Python Summit on February 17th, 2017.\n\nLicensed as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International",
