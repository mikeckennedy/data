  "description": "Deep learning is a useful tool for problems in computer vision, natural\nlanguage processing, and medicine. While it might seem difficult to get\nstarted in deep learning, Python libraries, such as Keras make deep\nlearning quite accessible. In this talk, we will discuss what deep\nlearning is, introduce NumPy and Keras, and discuss common mistakes and\ndebugging strategies. Throughout the talk, we will return to an example\nproject in the medical domain, which used deep learning on vocal data to\ndetermine whether a patient has a voice disorder called vocal\nhyperfunction.\n",
