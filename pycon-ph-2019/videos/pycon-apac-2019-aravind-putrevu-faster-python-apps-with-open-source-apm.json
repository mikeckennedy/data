  "description": "Slow applications are no fun. Application performance monitoring (APM) makes tracking down issues problems much easier. But which tools should you use?  With the release of Elastic APM, there\u2019s a new option. Language server and Python client is fully open source so you can get started with any app.  Elastic\u2019s APM was released some time ago, so it\u2019s a very fresh option for tracing performance problems in Python applications (and other runtimes as well). The basic platform is free so it should be a welcome change for Go developers used to spending huge bills on comparable hosted platforms.  It\u2019s useful out of the box for tracing basics on web requests including: - Request details - Response time percentiles - Transaction timelines - Application errors and stack traces - Individual code lines - Distributed Tracing  It can also be used to track any custom span in any Go application to find out where time is being lost and users are being slowed down.",
