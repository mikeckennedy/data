In order to learn\nsuccessfully it\u2019s important to have a mentor but it\u2019s equally\nimportant to learn how to be a good mentor. In my talk we\u2019ll explore\nwhat a mentor is, why we should all be(come) mentors, tips and tricks\nof mentorship, and concrete ways you can get involved as a mentor.\n\nAll of us are lifelong learners. Especially in technology there is\nalways something new to learn so we are always experts in one and\nbeginners in another field. In order to learn, make progress, and\nsucceed, it\u2019s really helpful to have a mentor. But it\u2019s equally\nimportant to learn how to be a good mentor to others. All of us\nstarted out as beginners and if it wasn\u2019t for the help of others, who\nshared their knowledge with us, lent a hand, and guided us, we\nprobably wouldn\u2019t be where we are today. Let\u2019s start giving back!\nLet\u2019s help others succeed!\n\nMentorship can be super fun and rewarding, you will learn a ton by\nhelping others, and you don't need to be an expert in order to mentor\nsomeone. In my talk we\u2019ll explore what a mentor is and why you should\nbecome a mentor. I\u2019ll also give you mentorship advice and tips and\nwe\u2019ll learn about the Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts of mentorship. Finally, I\u2019ll\npresent some concrete ways you can help as a mentor and which\nprojects you can get involved in.",
