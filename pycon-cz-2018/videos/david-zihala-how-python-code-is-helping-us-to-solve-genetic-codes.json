  "description": "Genetic code is a set of rules which are telling us how the organisms translate information from mRNA into amino acids, the main parts of all proteins. Majority of organisms use so called standard genetic code.\n\nHowever, a growing list of exceptions described from various organisms revealed an unexpected evolutionary flexibility of this fundamental molecular mechanism. Our lab has recently contributed to this field by discovering three novel genetic code variants.\n\nThe first part of the presentation will provide a brief introduction to the topic of genetic codes and the second part will be dedicated to our new findings in the filed of alternative genetic codes and how Python help us with some of them.",
