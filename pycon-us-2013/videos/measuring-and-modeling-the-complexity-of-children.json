  "summary": "Researchers have been modeling text difficulty for over 50 years. A\nvariety of models have been developed, but few have focused on books for\nemerging readers (Grades K-2). We used Python for nearly every aspect of\nthe project including collecting data from reading educators, analyzing\ntext features and psychometric data, and creating a predictive model.\nTools used include scipy, scikit-learn, pandas, and extensive use of the\nIPython Notebook which is demonstrated in the talk.\n",
