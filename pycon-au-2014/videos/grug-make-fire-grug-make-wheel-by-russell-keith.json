  "description": "In prehistoric times, Python developers were faced with a confusing\nlandscape of tools and conflicting advice when they wanted to package\ntheir Python modules for public release. As a result of all the\ndistutils/distribute/setuptools changes over the last 5 years, there's\nlots of confusion about what you should do when preparing a package for\ndistribution - and even some confusion about what the purpose of\npackaging is in the first place.\n\nAfter a mammoth effort from a number of volunteers in the community,\nover several years, this situation is changing. It's taken a while, but\nthe Python community has invented the wheel!\n\nIn this talk, we'll look at the process that has led to the development\nof the wheel format. But more importantly, we'll look at the steps you\nneed to take when packaging a module of Python code for others to use,\nand get it on the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n",
