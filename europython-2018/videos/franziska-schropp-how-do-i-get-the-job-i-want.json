  "description": "Engineers are rare, jobs are plenty, so far so good. But what if I don\u2019t\njust want any job that pays the bills, but the job that will push my\ncareer and that I actually enjoy doing every day? If your answer to why\nyou\u2019d like to join company XY is: \u201cWork from home and make good money\u201d,\nyou should not be surprised to not be taken into the next round. But\nwhat would be a good answer to that question? What should I say when\nasked where I see myself in 5 years? There are a lot of subtle aspects\nto succeeding and failing in the application process, from your initial\ncover letter to the on site visit meeting the team. As a tech recruiter,\nI\u2019d like to share with you the best and (sometimes quite entertaining)\nworst practices in the application process in order to help you get the\njob you want!\n",
