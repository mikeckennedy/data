  "description": "Introduction of super resolution with deep learning techniques. Super\nresolution is a technique which serve low- resolution image as input and\noutputs high-resolution images. How to preserve edges and restore detail\ninformation in the high-resolution image is very important. In this\ntalk, we will discuss the developments of super resolution, especially\nmethods using deep learning where pytorch is used during training.\n",
