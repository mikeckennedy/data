  "description": "**Christian Heimes** , Red Hat\n\n`**SSLError, now what?** <http://pycon.ru/2018/en/program/content/Heimes/>`__\n\nTLS/SSL is the most important and widely-used protocol for secure and\nencrypted communication, e.g. HTTPS. It offers more than just\nencryption. TLS also ensures data integrity and strong authentication\nwith X.509 certificates. But it provides merely a false sense of\nsecurity if you use it wrong.\n\nHave you ever encountered SSLError while connecting to a server, but you\ndidn\u2019t understand what is going on? Are you running production code\nwithout TLS/SSL protection or with certificate validation disabled,\nbecause you couldn\u2019t figure out how to make it work correctly?\n\nI\u2019ll give you the rundown of the basic cryptographic building blocks,\nprotocol handshake, inner structure of certificates, and PKI. You\u2019ll\nlearn about the best practices, debugging tools and tips how to diagnose\nTLS/SSL and how to deal with certificates.\n\nThis talk is suitable for both beginner and advanced Pythonistas.\n",
