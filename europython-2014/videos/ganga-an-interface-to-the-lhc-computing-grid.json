  "description": "`Ganga <https://cern.ch/ganga>`__ is a tool, designed and used by the\nlarge particle physics experiments at CERN. Written in pure Python, it\ndelivers a clean, usable interface to allow thousands of physicists to\ninteract with the huge computing resources available to them. It\nprovides a single platform with which data analysis tasks can be run on\nanything from a local machine to being distributed seamlessly to\ncomputing centres around the world.\n\nThe talk will cover the problems faced by physicists when dealing with\nthe computer infrastructure and how Ganga helps to solve this problem.\nIt will focus on how Python has helped create such a tool through its\nadvanced features such as metaclasses and integration into IPython.\n",
