  "description": "During this talk the attendees will have an opportunity to use the ELK(Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack to visualize their complex log data.\n\u200b\nAbstract\nData is the new bacon. For all industries, including health, security, entertainment, etc., it is impossible for anyone to store and analyze data without using an automated platform. A unified platform is needed to provide data visualization and extract intelligence.\n\nElasticsearch is a distributed, real-time, search and analytics platform. With the help of a restful API, Elasticsearch saves data and auto indexes the parsed data.\n\nDuring our talk, we will walk attendees through configuring the ELK stack and visualize datasets on Kibana.\n\n**Bio:** \nVarang Amin is working as a Sr Staff Engineer at Palo Alto Networks.
