  "description": "\"Adding Custom Control Panels to Your Plone Add-On\" by: Annette Lewis\n\nYou\u2019ve developed your add-on, and it\u2019s working great. Then, you realize there\u2019s a value that needs changing again and again. Rather than hard-coding these options in, take advantage of Plone\u2019s registry and create your own custom control panel to allow editable options through-the-web.\nI\u2019ll walk through the steps of adding a custom control panel to a theme add-on including:\n- Storing custom settings in the registry\n- Creating a form to manage these settings\n- Registering the control panel\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
