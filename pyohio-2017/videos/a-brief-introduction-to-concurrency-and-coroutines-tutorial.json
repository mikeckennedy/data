  "description": "This tutorial will introduce concurrency through python coroutines. Using a simple \"slow\" web service for an example, we will explore writing a client to perform concurrent requests, and then how to write the example service itself. The tutorial will also consider the purpose of concurrent programming, how concurrency differs from parallelism, and will discuss python syntax for coroutines.",
