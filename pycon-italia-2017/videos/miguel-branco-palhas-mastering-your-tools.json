  "description": "I\u2019m all about efficiency. Not just code execution efficiency, but also\nregarding my work tools, and my usage of them.Having been an avid\nprogrammer and Linux user for several years now, and being obsessed with\nmy workflow efficiency, I\u2019ve amassed a pretty good understanding of how\nto improve productivity when it comes to writing code. From small but\npowerful configurations for my text editor that took me weeks to find to\nsome not-so- well-known tools, I\u2019m always thinking about how I can tweak\nmy environment and workflow to perfection. Have you ever considered how\nmany keys you hit during the day? And how can you go about minimizing\nthat and train your muscle memory to make you more efficient? And what\nabout that thing you\u2019re not even noticing you\u2019re spending so much time\non, and that you could improve on?This talk will focus on very practical\nadvice aimed at answering the above questions.\n",
