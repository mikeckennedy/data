  "description": "Earth imaging satellites, just like our computers, are shrinking and\nbecoming more ubiquitous than ever before. It is now possible to obtain\nopen satellite data on a daily if not weekly basis and for this data to\nbe put to work; helping us better understand our planet and quickly\nrespond to disaster situations.\n\nIn this talk we will work through a jupyter notebook that covers the\nsatellite data ecosystem and the python tools that can be used to sift\nthrough and analyze that data. Topics include python tools for using\nOpen Street Maps data, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL),\nand OpenCV and NumPy for image processing. This talk is intended for\nnovice and intermediate python developers who are interested in using\ndata science and satellite imagery for social good and fundamental\nscientific research.\n",
