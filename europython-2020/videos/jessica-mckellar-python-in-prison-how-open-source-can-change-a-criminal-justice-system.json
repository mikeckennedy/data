  "description": "The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with over 2.2 million people behind bars in our prisons, jails, juvenile facilities, and detention centers.\r\n\r\nThe system is racist and ineffective, but how do we change something so big and so economically entrenched, especially as software engineers?\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at how Python classes in US prisons are transforming rehabilitation and re-entry, and talk about what we can do as individuals and as an open source community to dismantle an unjust system.",
