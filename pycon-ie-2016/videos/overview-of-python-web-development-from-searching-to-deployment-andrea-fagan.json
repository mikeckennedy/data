  "description": "This talk is about helping people new to development & Python to\nconnect the dots between googling \u201dpython web development\u201d and\nreaching deployment. When entering the world of development there is a\nhuge learning curve. It\u2019s not just about understanding python syntax\nand writing a function. How does everything fit together? This talk\nwill attempt to introduce the budding developer to the options\navailable and why you may choose one over another.\n\nI will run through the following topics:\n\n* The major python web frameworks that exist. We will examine the pros and cons of the main\n  players.\n* Python itself, Apis vs Services, what goes where?\n* How to build restfully and the importance of adhering to correct http\n  protocols. How does javascript know what to do?\n* The merits of testing and running through the different testing\n  libraries that are available.\n* Brief intro to Github and pointing to resources to help learn how to\n  commit.\n* Highlighting any \u201cgotchas\u201d\n* Deployment tools.\n* Hosting, where to go?\n* How to google for relevant answers.\n* Python community for answers. (globally and local)\n\nHopefully those that attending will have a greater understanding of\nthe whole development system so they will know what to research for\neach step and where to find answers.\n",
