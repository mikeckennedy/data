  "description": "A very fast introduction to Python for software developers with\nexperience in other languages. Instead of a traditional top-down\npresentation of Python's features, syntax, and semantics, students are\nimmersed in the language bottom-up with hundreds of small examples using\nthe interactive interpreter to quickly gain familiarity with most of the\ncore language features. Special attention is given to concepts in Python\nthat often trip up those new to the language.\n",
