  "abstract": "I am a backend Software Engineer at Yelp who uses Python extensively for\nbuilding Yelps infrastructure and internal tools. I also suffer from a\ngenetic disorder called Albinism which often results in limited visual\nacuity that can range from 20/120 to 20/200 in most common cases. With\nsuch a low vision it's extremely difficult to read the computer screen\nwithout the use of on-screen magnifiers. In this talk, we will see how a\nperson with adverse visual acuity can thrive and be successful in the\nfield of Software Engineering. We will address the importance and\nmeaning of accessibility for Software Engineers with partial vision and\nrecommend some best practices that are available today. We will also\ntalk about the importance of an inclusive work culture that can help\nfoster creativity and ease ramp up for a Software Engineer with a\ndisability.\n",
