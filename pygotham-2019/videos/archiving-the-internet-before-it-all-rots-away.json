  "description": "Could you imagine an internet where all links stopped working after 4 years?\nAll the old blogs from the 90's... gone, all your hot takes on Twitter...\ngone, all the news and reporting... gone.\n\nSome of that decay is good, no one wants the *entire* internet to be\npreserved for eterninty, but most of that decay leads to great content\ndisappearing forever, and future generations being deprived of access to the\nmost important medium for knowledge in the last half century.  If no one\nworked on preserving that information, the human race would be facing a loss\nof knowledge many times greater than the burning of the Library of\nAlexandria.\n\nLuckily organizations like Archive.org and the Internet Preservation\nConsortium work tirelessly every day to save what they can.  But archiving\ndoesn't have to be exclusive to big organizations, we can all play a part by\narchiving the stuff that matters to us locally.  Learn about the internet\narchiving community, the tools of the trade, and how to save content you\ncare about in this talk!",
