  "description": "Open Sourcing a Python project can teach you lessons in so diverse\nfields as Software Engineering, Project Management, Marketing,\nCommunity Management and more. Looking back at the past 7 years,\nCodespeed, my first Open Source project, has been a niche but very\nsuccessful project by many metrics. It is or has been in use by\nwell-known projects and organizations like the PSF, PyPy, Twisted,\nRubySpec, Julia (lang), companies like AMD, Dropbox and many others,\nand to this date there is no clear alternative. And yet its codebase\nhas become a mess and active development grounded to a halt for a\nspell of two or three years.\n\nWhat lessons can we learn from that story? This talk will highlight\nsome aspects that went horribly wrong, as well as explain some\nconcepts in the original design that proved key for the project's\nsuccess.\n",
