  "description": "We present \u201cScikit-build\u201d, an improved build system generator for\nCPython C/C++/Fortran/Cython extensions. It provides improved support\nfor additional compilers, build systems, cross compilation, and locating\ndependencies and determining their build requirements over\ndistutils/setuptools. We also describe how ITK and VTK C++ scientific\nlibraries were updated to make use of scikit-build to ultimately be\npublished as wheels.Presenter(s): Speaker: Jean- Christophe\nFillion-Robin, Kitware, Inc.
