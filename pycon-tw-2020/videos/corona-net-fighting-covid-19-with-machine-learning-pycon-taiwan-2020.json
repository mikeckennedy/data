  "description": "Day 2, R3 11:55\u201312:10\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce my open source Python project, Corona-Net, COVID-19 chest CT segmentation  with PyTorch. I leverage the EfficientNet model for image-level COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the UNet -- a Fully Convolutional encoder-decoder network -- for binary and multi-class medical segmentation. Through UNet, I successfully detect and localise COVID-19 symptoms, including ground-glass, consolidation and pleural effusion, from axial chest CT slices, using open source datasets and annotations.\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\n\nSpeaker: Choi Ching Lam\n\nChoi Ching Lam is a high school programmer from Hong Kong, keenly interested in Computer Vision and Scientific Computing. She is an open source enthusiast with a deep appreciation for Python and Julia. Presently an intern at NVIDIA's AI Tech Center, Ching Lam aspires to become a Machine Learning researcher.",
