  "description": "Partial evaluation is a powerful optimization technique that allows you to use the strengths of Python (expressive, fast runtime), and avoid it's weaknesses (slow interpretation). It uses information available at run-time to generate specialized program code that runs faster than the generic one. Partial evaluation has a lot of successful applications, but is not widely used in the Python community.\n\nThe talk will focus on:\n\n- what is partial evaluation\n- simple example of partial evaluation, it's analysis and benchmark\n- when to use partial evaluation\n- real-world example: 10x speedup of an OLAP calculation engine\n- practical advice, problems, working around them\n- partial evaluation library for Python",
