  "description": "Have you ever wanted to get user input from your command line program?\nOr maybe color the output a bit? Or do you want to write an immersive\nterminal application like top, or even vim? Then you need to speak a bit\nof terminal! This talk describes how to talk to your terminal from\nscratch and goes on to show why the Python library prompt-toolkit is so\nawesome.\n\nThe terminal emulators we run so many of our programming tools in are\nmore powerful than we give them credit for, and the key to that power is\nunderstanding the interface. This talk will cover terminal colors and\nstyles, writing to arbitrary portions of the screen, handling signals\nfrom the terminal, determining the terminal\u2019s dimensions and scrollback\nbuffer behavior.\n\nTerminal programming can get hairy, especially if you want to support\nmultiple platforms like Mac, Linux and Win; along the way we\u2019ll deal\nwith encoding issues, automatisation issues and look into 4 decades\u2019 of\nterminal communication. By gaining a deeper understanding of these\nissues, we\u2019ll be able to choose from the abstractions over them offered\nby Python libraries like Blessings, prompt-toolkit, asciimatics etc.\n",
