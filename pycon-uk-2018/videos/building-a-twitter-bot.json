  "description": "Lessons learned from using DEFRA data to build a Twitter Bot\n\nTwitter is over run with bots, so why not add your own? Twitter bots\nmake up an estimated 15% of accounts on twitter partly because they\u2019re\nso easy to make. As a beginner python learner, finding a project that\nwas challenging but also manageable by myself was difficult, but twitter\nand defra air pollution data provided the perfect answer. I built a\ntwitter bot that takes the air pollution every hour from the DEFRA API,\nprocesses it and tweets it.\n\nBuilding a twitter bot required learning about APIs, processing data,\njson, dictionaries and docker. I learned a lot about programming, but I\nhave also learned a lot about air pollution in Sheffield City Centre,\nit\u2019s changes over time, and what causes spikes and troughs.\n\nIn this talk I\u2019ll discuss using the package tweepy to build a bot and\nhow I learned about APIs, JSON, dictionaries and docker along the way.\nI\u2019ll also discuss the DEFRA air pollution data, how you can access your\nlocal data and why the air pollution API documentation from DEFRA is\nawful for beginners.",
