  "description": "This talk is about people, not tools.\n\nI would like to share one recipe of building a community from scratch.\n\nIt reveals hands-on experience about the organisational journey,\nincluding insider details and financial questions.\n\nThe information is packed into the story, how one year ago a tempting\nidea of making a little Python conference in Munich was born. Six month\nlater, with poor German skills, no business network and mostly foreign\ncrew a little idea was converted into PyCon.DE. This conference had a\nnoticeable Italian flavour, and it\u2019s time to tell why.\n",
