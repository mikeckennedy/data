  "summary": "How hard is it to port a library to python 3? How much work is it going\nforward? Based on two examples (a pure Python, and a C-extension-based\nlibrary), I want to show how in my experience the work required is\nmodest, without significant impact on old code. At the same time,\nkeeping Python2 compatibility constrains development under Python 3\nbecause only the common subset of features can be used.\n",
