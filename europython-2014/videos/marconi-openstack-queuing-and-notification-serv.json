  "description": "Similar to other message bus frameworks, Marconi's main goals are:\nperformance, availability, durability, fault-tolerance and scalability.\nBesides providing support for queuing and notification services through\nOpenStack, Marconi aims to ease the design of distributed systems and\nallow for asynchronous work distribution without creating yet another\nmessage broker. This talk aims to give the audience a broad look at\nMarconi\u2019s architecture, design, technologies used, development process,\nand discuss the issues it adresses.\n",
