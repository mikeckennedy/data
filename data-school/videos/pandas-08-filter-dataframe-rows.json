  "description": "Let's say that you only want to display the rows of a DataFrame which have a certain column value. How would you do it? pandas makes it easy, but the notation can be confusing and thus difficult to remember. In this video, I'll work up to the solution step-by-step using regular Python code so that you can truly understand the logic behind pandas filtering notation.\n\nThis is video 8 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
