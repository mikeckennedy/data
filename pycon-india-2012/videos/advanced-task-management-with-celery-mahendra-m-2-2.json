  "description": "Celery is a really good framework for doing background task processing in Python (and other languages). While it is ridiculously easy to use celery, doing complex task flow has been a challenge in celery. (w.r.t task trees/graphs/dependecies etc.)\nThis talk introduces the audience to these challenges in celery and also explains how these can be fixed programmatically and by using latest features in Celery (3+).",
