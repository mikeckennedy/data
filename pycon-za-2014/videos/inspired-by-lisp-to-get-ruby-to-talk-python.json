  "summary": "Having pushed Ruby to the limits of what it can accomplish in terms of\nnumber crunching and data analysis, we looked around for another\nsolution in the data analysis and modelling space. We quickly found that\nwith packages and tools like Numpy, Pandas, the iPython Notebook and new\npackages like Blaze, Python looked to be a good language fit. Porting a\nlarge existing codebase and accompanying infrastructure from a Ruby to\nPython ecosystem simply wasn't an option, so we had to do something\nclever (and fun!). This talk will be about how we managed to leverage\nthe power of Python while retaining our modelling code in Ruby (and\nopening up opportunity for other languages), by embracing Lisp\u2019s\ncode-is-data philosophy.\n",
