  "description": "Like a lot of people, I like to have well tested code, and like a lot of\npeople I sometimes find it hard work to write good tests for my code.\nSometimes the solution is just to get better at writing tests, but I've\noften found that when I'm struggling to write a good test for some code,\nit's a sign that there's something I could improve about the code\nitself.\n\nIn this talk, I'd like to explain why I think this happens. I'll then\ngive a series of examples of problems that I've encountered when testing\ncode, and how you can solve these problems, often by applying fairly\nbasic principles, while making your code better at the same time.\n\nThe talk should be accessible to programmers of all levels.\n",
