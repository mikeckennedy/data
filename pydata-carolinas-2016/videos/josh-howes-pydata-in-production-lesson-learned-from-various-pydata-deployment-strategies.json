However after the initial\nmodel fitting a common challenge often arises - how do we put these\nmodels in production ensuring that it fits into a larger\norganizational architecture? In this talk we outline the various\nstrateg\n\nThe PyData stack offers a remarkably powerful toolkit for building\ncomplex machine learning and analytical components quickly. However,\nmachine learning doesn't happen in a vacuum. It is part a large system\nof enterprise software responsible for data processing and must play-\nwell with other tools in the ecosystem. In order to get the benefits\nof rapid development while not sacrificing the non-functional\nrequirements, MaxPoint as implemented and tested multiple deployment\nmodels for software relying on the PyData stack.
