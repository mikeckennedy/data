  "description": "Python is a decades-strong language with a large community, and it has a\nsolid foundation on the server, but it doesn't have a good user story in\nthe browser... until now.\n\nThe BeeWare project aims to bring Python natively, everywhere. Using a\ncombination of the Batavia and Toga projects, we can develop and\nentirely native web experience in Python, no JavaScript required.\n\nDuring this talk, you will learn about how the BeeWare project has built\nBatavia, a Python virtual machine in JavaScript; and Toga, a\nmulti-platform native API wrapper; a combination of which can be used to\nbuild an entire web platform in Python only.\n",
