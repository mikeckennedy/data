  "description": "Operations at Tesco have historically been quite manual with varying amounts of analytical knowhow applied. As data science and big data technology becomes more embedded into the way we work, this is shifting to centralised solutions at scale. This presents challenges, but also large benefits for producing national, and even international level solutions. We present a couple of examples of how we implement large scale solutions that are now embedded into the operations of Tesco.",
