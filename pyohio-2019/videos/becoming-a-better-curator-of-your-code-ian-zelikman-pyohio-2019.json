  "description": "Writing code that functions correctly is only part of the development\nprocess. The majority of our time is spent reading, maintaining and\nrefactoring our code.\n\nIn this talk we will discuss how when we see our work as code curation\nwe actually enable our job to be much easier and productive.\n\nWe will start the talk with an introduction to the role of a curator and\nhow it applies to software engineers.\n\nIn this talk we will discuss some principals and techniques that enable\nus to produce better code but applying them with the curation mindset of\nmaintaining code quality beyond producing the next bug free feature.\n\nSome of the topics we will cover:\n\n-  Promote the use of conventions and style guides for your team\n-  Code readability matters\n-  The first goal of writing tests should be to document the code\n   functionality\n-  Encourage discussion on feature implementation\n-  Encourage discussion during code reviews\n-  Boy Scout rule - leave the code in a better shape than which you\n   found it\n-  Embrace new and mature technologies, and try to incorporate them into\n   your code when applicable\n\nAt the end of the talk we will review the software curation mindset and\nhow you can bring it to your organization.\n",
