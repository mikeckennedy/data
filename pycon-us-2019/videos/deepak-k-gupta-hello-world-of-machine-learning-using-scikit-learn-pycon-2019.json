  "description": "***Welcome to the Machine Learning tutorial for absolute beginners.***\n\n    This tutorial will not make you an expert in Machine Learning but\n    will cover enough things to acquaint, enable and empower you to\n    understand, explore and exploits the concept and idea behind it.\n\n--------------\n\n**We'll be learning by generating our own data with bare minimal data\npoints (5 - 10) so that we can manually verify our machine learning\nalgorithms to understand it better.**\n\n*This will also help us to see how changes in data can impact our\nMachine Learning Algorithms. At the end of this tutorial, we'll also be\nusing one real-world Dataset and play with it.*\n\n--------------\n\n*In this tutorial, I'll be covering at least 3 well-known ML\nalgorithms(KNN, Linear and Logistic Regression) along with all the maths\nbehind it. We'll end the tutorial with a real-world mapping application*\n\n*There is no major prerequisite for attending this, you just need to\nknow the basics of python language and I'll cover the rest. We'll be\nusing Scikit Learn for simplicity purpose, again, you don't need to have\nany prior experience with Scikit Learn or for that matter with Machine\nLearning*\n",
