  "description": "Django's admin is a great tool but it isn't always the easiest or\nfriendliest to set up and customize. The ModelAdmin class has a lot of\nattributes and methods to understand and come to grips with. On top of\nthese attributes, the admin's inlines, custom actions, custom media, and\nmore mean that, really, you can do anything you need with the admin...if\nyou can figure out how. The docs are good but leave a lot to\nexperimentation and the code is notoriously dense.\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of setting up the admin so you\ncan get your job done. Then we'll dive deeper and see how advanced\nfeatures like autocomplete, Markdown editors, image editors, and others\nwould be added to make the admin really shine.\n",
