  "description": "In this talk I will introduce the topic of live coding; the interactive\nprogramming experience for generating audio and visuals but this talk\nwill mainly focus on audio. Live coders use programming languages to\ndescribe rules for generating music but then re-write these rules while\nthe program is running. By continually writing and re-writing these\nrules live coders creating a shifting musical experience that is always\nin flux. All of this happens live in front of audience with the code\nprojected for all to see. I will go on to discuss the multiple tools\nthat are available for live coding and showcase the FoxDot environment,\nwhich allows you to live code music using Python. I will talk about the\nmotivation for developing FoxDot and describe some of its key features\nas well as how you can set it up yourself at home. The talk will be\nconcluded with a short demonstration that will be part explanation and\npart performance.\n",
