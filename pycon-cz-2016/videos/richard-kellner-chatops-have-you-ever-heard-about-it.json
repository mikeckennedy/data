  "description": "ChatOps is a term for a collaborative way of running DevOps,\nincluding operating aspects of systems and infrastructure through an\nonline chat. It combines a powerful way to get things done with a\nmore human way of working.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. In this talk I would like to explain\nvarious stages of adoption. I also want to inspire you to implement\nChatOps into your workflow and to suggest ideas how to do that. I\nwill show you why Python is the ideal language for building a ChatOps\nstack. It is quick and fun to build new chat commands and even a\nperson who doesn\u2019t know Python can easily start learning and see the\nresults immediately.",
