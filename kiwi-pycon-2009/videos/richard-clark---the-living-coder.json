  "description": "The Living Coder\n\nPresented by Richard Clark\n\nAbstract\n\nTales, anecdotes philosophy and musings about the life that surrounds\nthe code we write.\n\nOutline\n\nThe project manager called me to his office and said \"I know you did\nthis in two weeks in perl, but applications here must be written in\njava, because java programmers are much easier to find\". When I left 6\nmonths later, the same manager said \"You wouldn't happen to know any\njava programmers would you? we have nobody to replace you..\". This is\nthe story of the life that exists around the code we write.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n",
