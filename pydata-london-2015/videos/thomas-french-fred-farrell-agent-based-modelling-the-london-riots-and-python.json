  "description": "In this talk we will give an introduction to Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)\nusing Python. ABM is a technique used to build simulated populations of\nheterogeneous individuals that are governed by rules of behaviour. These\nindividuals, or agents, interact in simulated environments in which we\nstudy their emergent behaviour. We build agent-based models in order to\ntry explain why people do what they do. In this talk, we'll briefly show\nhow we develop and validate agent populations. We will then present\non-going work modelling the 2011 London riots, investigating how riots\nspread and in particular focussing on police response. Finally, we\u2019ll\ndiscuss why we use Python and the PyData stack to develop models, and\nmention how we are starting to use machine learning (scikit-learn) for\nlearning rules of behaviour.\n",
