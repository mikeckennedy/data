  "description": "In this talk, aimed at Pythonistas of all levels, we will learn how ActivityPub, the protocols underlying distributed social networks, power the open web by building a ActivityPub server in Python. The concepts that make up ActivityPub will be learned with concrete Python examples instead of abstract concepts, with the hope that attendees have a better handle on the technologies powering Mastodon, PixelFed, and the rest of the Fediverse.\n",
