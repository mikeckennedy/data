  "description": "Medieval European Nobility was obsessed with Lineage. They created a\nHeraldic System to track families, which assigned each family a unique\nCoat of Arms.\n\nAny painting of the Coat of Arms was not the official version. The\nofficial version was a \"Blazon\" - a precise, terse description in\nheraldic language. This heraldic language reads like English, Latin,\nFrench, and XML had a baby. It's a fully recursive language with a\nformal grammar, variable assignment, positional arguments, and also,\nLions, Bears, and Pythons.\n\nHere's an example: *Sable, on a fesse or three lions gules*\n\nIn this talk, we look at parsing this Medieval *Domain Specific\nLanguage* with Python. Along the way, we'll learn a little history, and\nthe tools for parsing and writing your own DSL.\n",
