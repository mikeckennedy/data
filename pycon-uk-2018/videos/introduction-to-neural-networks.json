  "description": "So, you keep hearing about neural networks. Perhaps you've even gone to\na talk or two, but are still wondering exactly how a neural network\nworks, what you'd use one for and how to get started. This talk has you\ncovered.\n\nWe'll illustrate the basic concepts by walking through implementing a\nneural network from scratch in Python, and then move on to the powerful\nreal world libraries you'd use in production.\n\nThis session is aimed at programmers of all experience levels who are\nnewcomers to the subject of neural networks. If you're already using\nthem as part of your work, there will likely be nothing new for you\nhere.\n",
