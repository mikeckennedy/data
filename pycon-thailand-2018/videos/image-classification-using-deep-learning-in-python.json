  "description": "I will be talking about the Capsule Networks which is the latest buzz word in whole deep learning community. The talk will connect the dots from the past methods till Capsule networks and show how to make them work in python.\n\n\n\n--------\n\nI have done my Bachelors and Masters of Technology from prestigious Indian Institute of Technology -Delhi, in Mathematics and Computing. Since college days, I have been working in neural network projects using all kinds of languages like MATLAB, Java and python. I did internship in distributed computing at Chinese Academy of Science in 2011 and the experience which I had there was incredible. It taught me the importance and pleasure of interacting and sharing knowledge with people around the world. Currently I am working as a Senior Data Scientist in an analytics firm BRIDGEi2i Analytics Solutions in Bangalore.",
