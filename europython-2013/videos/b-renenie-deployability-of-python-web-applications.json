  "description": "When it comes to deploying web applications, it seems the Python and\nDjango world doesn\u2019t exactly follows the Zen mantra of \u201cThere should be\none \u2013 and preferably only one \u2013 obvious way to do it\u201d. This talk will\nexplain a deployment approach based on the `Twelve-Factor\nmethodology <http://12factor.net/>`__ that leverages standard Python and\nsystem administration techniques.\n\nThis approach allows easy deployments on various hosting environments\n(PaaS or custom-build infrastructure), minimizes dev/prod divergence and\nallows interoperability with non-python systems. It is particularly\nsuited for teams practicing continuous deployment.\n\nMost examples and techniques will be based on Django but they can easily\nbe adapted to other Python web frameworks. This talk targets DevOps\npeople and/or application developers.\n",
