  "description": "How Python is guiding infrastructure construction in Africa\n\nPresented by Roy Hyunjin Han (InvisibleRoads)\n\nA whirlwind tour of the roles of different Python modules in the\narchitecture of a geospatial infrastructure planning system.\n\nWe used Python to transform an elaborate, multistep process for finding\nand connecting households in villages into a single, streamlined\nplanning experience. I'll explain how Python's freely available\nlibraries empowered a small team of developers under a minimal budget\nand timeframe. Now just imagine if we had to do the same thing with\nJava.\n",
