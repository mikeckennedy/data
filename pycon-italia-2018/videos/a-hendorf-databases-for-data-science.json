  "description": "In this talk I\u2019ll present the usefulness of databases for data science\nprojects.\n\nDatabases have been around for decades and were highly optimised for\ndata aggregations during that time. Not only *Big data* has changed the\nlandscape of databases massively in the past years - we nowadays can\nfind many *Open Source* projects among the most popular dbs.\n\nAfter this talk you will be enabled to decide if a database can make\nyour work more efficient and which direction to look to.\n\nOutline:\n\n1. A quick recap on database history, *it all starts in Florence - where\n   else\u2026*.\n\n2. What is a database? What\u2019s a data store? data lake?\u2026\n\n3. Relational SQL systems and their benefits for DS\n\n4. NoSQL systems and their benefits for DS\n\n5. How to chose the db fitting your needs.\n\nin \\_\\_on **sabato 21 aprile** at 17:00 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
