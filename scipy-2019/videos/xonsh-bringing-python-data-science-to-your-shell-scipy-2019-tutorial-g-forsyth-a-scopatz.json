  "description": "Xonsh is an interactive, cross-platform Python/Unix Shell hybrid language that makes it easy to switch between Python operations and command line interfaces. While Python has a wealth of data science libraries and tools, there are still plenty of utilities that live outside of the scientific Python ecosystem. Xonsh provides a way of gluing ALL of your tools together. Additionally, as a shell, xonsh comes with batteries-included features that are important in a scientific context. If you are new to shells, want to use Python for *everything*, or just plain fed up with sh-lang syntax, this tutorial is for you!",
