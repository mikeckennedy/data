  "abstract": "This talk presents a rich data modelling exercise using the latest\nfunctionality provided by PostgreSQL. Our goal is to cover the advances\nmade by these tools in the past decade and illustrating how they can be\nused to model and query big data problems. After all, SQL was the\noriginal \"big data\" technology. And, while SQL has fallen out of the\nhype cycle, it remains a powerful, sophisticated, and mature technology\nfor solving real-world business problems.\n\nThe talk will propose a \"data-first\" strategy for modelling business\nproblems and illustrate how to advanced SQL functionality can help\nenforce constraints and implement business logic in a safe, simple, and\nrobust way.\n",
