  "description": "Digital Signal Processing and Player Piano don't normally come together\nin the same sentance. Player Pianos that are 100+ years old are awesome\nartisan artifacts, but they don't play digital formats very well. This\ntalk will show how we take a 100+ year old technology and marry it to\nthe digital age via Python libraries and precision lasers!\n\nIn this discussion we will cover how we are creating our own\n\"Plug-n-Stream Player Piano\". We will take a look at the different\ndigital signal processing Python libraries, their functionality, and\nrequirements for converting audio streams to piano playable audio files.\nAfter a brief walk through of our prototyped hardware, we will dissect\nthe digital signal processing, converting streaming music to data for\nthe Player Piano. With a real Player Piano in the room we will demo\nstreaming music from our devices onto the piano.\n\nLIVE(ish) Piano Playing!\n",
