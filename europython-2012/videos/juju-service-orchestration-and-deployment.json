  "description": "Juju is a new opensource configuration management and tool for deploying\nservices into a cloud and data center environments. Juju provides a\nhigher level semantic to its users of service level management rather\nthan machine management. By rethinking this focus, Juju is able to\nprovide real reuse of service definitions in much the same way that\npackage management allows deployment and reuse of software bits in many\ndifferent context. Juju\u2019s goal is to be the apt of the clouds. By\nproviding these higher level semantics to end users, juju aims to be a\npreferred solution for deploying services to the cloud. Underneath the\nhood, juju is written in python, but part of its beauty is you can write\nservice definitions in any language. Juju relies on zookeeper for\ndistributed coordination and state management of the managed machines,\nand LXC for higher utilization of machines and minimal separation of\ndeployed services. It can deploy to physical machines as well as cloud\nenvironments like AWS/EC2 and Openstack.\n",
