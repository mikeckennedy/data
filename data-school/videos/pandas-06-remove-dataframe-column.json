  "description": "If you have DataFrame columns that you're never going to use, you may want to remove them entirely in order to focus on the columns that you do use. In this video, I'll show you how to remove columns (and rows), and will briefly explain the meaning of the \"axis\" and \"inplace\" parameters.\n\nThis is video 6 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
