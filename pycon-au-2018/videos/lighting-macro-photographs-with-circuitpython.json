  "description": "LED lighting rigs are expensive. Worse, they have little to no controls aside from on/off. Most are not dimmable and changing colors requires the use of gels. In this talk I will discuss how CircuitPython was used in conjunction with LEDs and microcontrollers to make a custom LED photo lighting rig.",
