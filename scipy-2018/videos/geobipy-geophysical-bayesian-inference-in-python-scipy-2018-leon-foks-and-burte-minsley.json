  "description": "We present a public domain, open-source, object-oriented python package\ncalled GeoBIPy, Geophysical Bayesian Inference in Python, a parallel\nenabled trans- dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion framework\nfor geophysical data. GeoBIPy optimally computes a subsurface physical\nproperty model that fits the measured data, in addition to an ensemble\nof possible models, thus providing an estimation of uncertainty at\ndifferent locations within the model. GeoBIPy uses the parallel-enabled\npython packages mpi4py and h5py in order to leverage large-scale\ndistributed memory architectures. We show that large datasets taking\nover 3 months to invert can be completed in 2.5 days using 2016\ncores.Presenter(s): Speaker: Leon Foks, Apogee Engineering contracted to\nUnited State Geological Survey Speaker: Burke Minsley, United States\nGeological Survey\n",
