  "description": "There are hundreds of books about compilers, but only three about\nwriting debuggers. Spreadsheets are used more than any other statistical\ntool, but version control still can't handle them. Everyone thinks we\nshould teach kids to program, but courses on computing education are\nalmost nonexistent. This talk explores why these gaps exist and what\nthey tell us about computing today and in future.\n\nGreg Wilson Bio\n---------------\n\nGreg Wilson is the co-founder of Software Carpentry, a volunteer\norganization that teaches basic computing skills to researchers in a\nwide range of disciplines. He has worked for 30 years in both industry\nand academia, and is the author or editor of several books on computing\n(including the 2008 Jolt Award winner \"Beautiful Code\") and two for\nchildren. Greg received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University\nof Edinburgh in 1993.\n",
