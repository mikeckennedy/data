  "description": "Python is extensively used in in the field of robotics mainly because of\nthe easiness in implementation. Some of the popular python frameworks\nused in robotics are Robotic Operating System(ROS), OpenCV-Python and\nPyQT\n\nMy talk will be divided into the following broad categories:\n\n-  Introduction to robotics and associated technologies\n\n-  Introduction to arduino and interfacing\n\n-  Introduction to raspberry Pi and interfacing\n\n-  Various Python frameworks used in robotics\n\n-  Introduction to ROS framework and importance of rospy\n\n-  Introduction of OpenCV and explantion of python wrapper of OpenCV\n\n-  Introduction to image processing using ROS and Python\n\n-  Introduction to PIL(Python Image Processing Library)\n\n-  Introduction to Python GUI toolkit such as PyQT (with demos and\n   examples)",
