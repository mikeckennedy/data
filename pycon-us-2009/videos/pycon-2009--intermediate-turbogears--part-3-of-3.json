  "description": "Have you conquered the basics of Pylons/TurboGears2 (or just taken the\nmorning class)? Do you want to understand more about how everything\nworks, and how you can go beyond the basics to understand how to\ncustomize things? This class will take you from a basic understanding of\nhow to use the framework, to a clear picture of how the framework pieces\nare put together. I will also cover how to create REST+JSON based web\nservices, we'll focus particularly on how all this works with rich\njavascript based user interfaces, but the techniques should easily apply\nto Flex, or other \"Rich Internet Application\" tools.\n",
