The number of opportunities often don't seem as many\nfor an industry that big, nonetheless.\n\nRegardless of how long you've been in this industry, you often feel\noverwhelmed, unfocused, demotivated by the size of the industry, the\nuncertainty it generates and the urge of doing something others consider\nimportant.\n\nThroughout this talk, the audience will learn how to grow in an industry\nthat is often blasted with intellectual appearances, quantity over\nquality and unstoppable, constant, changes. The talk provides tips to\ncope with large communities and fields as well as experiences and\nexamples.\n",
