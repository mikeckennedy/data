  "description": "With $150 billion generated in profit a year, human trafficking is an\nillicit business model that affects children and adults in every community\nin the United States. Any strategy to reduce the prevalence of the crime\nmust include reducing the amount of profit. Working with the New York Police\nDepartment, I built a prototype using NLP to target the buyers contributing\nthe wealth to New York's human trafficking economy. That prototype went on\nto serve nine jurisdictions across the United States and reach tens of\nthousands of buyers.\n\nThis talk explores the development of the chatbot engaging with buyers every\nhour of every day across the country to reduce the economic incentives\nbehind human trafficking. We'll explore scoping the domain of an NLP\nproblem, designing the right machine learning model to address it, and\ncreative ways to collect sufficient data to train an effective model.",
