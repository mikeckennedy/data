  "description": "Django is an excellent web development platform with an extensive\ndevelopers community. It may be the most popular Python web framework\nnowadays. However, the exisiting django based CMS products are not as\nfeature complete as other comparable solutions (Drupal, Plone, Alfresco,\nModX, etc.).\n\nThe Merengue project tries to fill this gap. It is financed by the\nUniversity of M\u00e1laga (Spain) and takes advantage of existing code and\nknowledge from other projects (Plone, Drupal, Pinax, django-cms,\nfeincms, LFC, etc.)\n",
