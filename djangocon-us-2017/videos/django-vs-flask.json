  "description": "DjangoCon US 2017 - Django vs Flask by David \"DB\" Baumgold\n\nWhen it comes to web development in Python, Django isn\u2019t the only game in town. Flask is a scrappy young framework that takes a very different approach \u2013 whereas Django ships with tons of features ready and eager to be used, Flask provides a bare minimum feature-set with rock-solid extensibility and incredible flexibility. This talk, given by a web developer who has experience with both frameworks, takes a good look at the pros and cons for both Flask and Django. If you\u2019ve ever felt that Django is too hard to learn, or too inflexible, this is the talk for you!\n\nOutline\n\nWhat is Flask?\nHistorical background\n\nDjango vs Flask\nIdeological differences\nExample \u201chello, world\u201d websites\n\nDatabase support\nDjango ORM vs SQLAlchemy, Peewee, etc\u2026\nNon-relational databases\n\nUser model\ndjango.contrib.auth vs Flask-Login, Flask-Principle\nDjango Admin vs Flask-Admin\n\nDjango apps vs Flask Blueprints\n\nDjango REST Framework & comparisons to Flask\n\nWhich is better? Depends on your use-case\n\nhttps://2017.djangocon.us/talks/django-vs-flask/",
