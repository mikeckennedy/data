  "description": "Spectral analysis is an important and useful technique in many areas of\nscience and engineering, and the Fast Fourier Transform is one of the\nmost important algorithms, but the fundamental ideas of signal\nprocessing are not as widely known as they should be.\n\nFortunately, Python provides an accessible and enjoyable way to get\nstarted. \u00a0In this tutorial, I present material from my book, *Think\nDSP*, and from a class I teach at Olin College. \u00a0We will work with audio\nsignals, including music and other recorded sounds, and visualize their\nspectrums and spectrograms. \u00a0We will synthesize simple sounds and learn\nabout harmonic structure, chirps, filtering, and convolution.\n",
