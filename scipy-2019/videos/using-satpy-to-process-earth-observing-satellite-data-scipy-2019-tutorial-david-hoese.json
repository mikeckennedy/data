  "description": "This tutorial is an introduction to SatPy, a python library for easily reading and working with earth-observing satellite data like that of the NOAA-20 VIIRS or GOES-16 ABI instruments. It is aimed at scientific users who would like to simplify some of their satellite data processing tasks. No previous experience with SatPy is needed. During this tutorial we\u2019ll work through common satellite processing tasks using SatPy using Jupyter Notebook examples with real instrument data.",
