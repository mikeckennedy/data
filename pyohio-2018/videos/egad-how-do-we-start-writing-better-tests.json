  "abstract": "To show how to develop a test automation solution for champions, we will\nfollow the story of \u201cAmanda the Panda\u201d (representing the everyday\nPythoneer) as she jumps into testing and automation with Python.\n\nHer journey includes:\n\n1.  How do I play \u201cbuzzword bingo\u201d for testing?\n2.  Why do we need feature tests and not just unit tests?\n3.  What skills do I need?\n4.  What framework should I use?\n5.  How do I avoid duplicating test code?\n6.  How do I handle test data?\n7.  There are too many tests! Which ones should I automate?\n8.  How do I run tests in continuous integration?\n9.  How do I make tests reliable so they stop failing again and again?\n10. How do I hire Software Engineers in Test?\n\nAll examples will be given in Python (of course).\n",
