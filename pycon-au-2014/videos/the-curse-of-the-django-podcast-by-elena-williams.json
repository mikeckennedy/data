  "description": "The Django community is full of amazing, enthusiastic and multi-talented\nindividuals who love to take on exciting new extra-curricular projects\nin their massive amounts of spare time.\n\nA Django podcast is an excellent example of this kind of project and it\nis one that has been taken up no less than 5 times so far.\n\nI am the latest to take up this torch.\n\nThis has so far been an amazing, educational, exhilarating experience: I\nhave had the honour of gathering the thoughts of some of the best,\nbrightest and most prolific in our community. It's been a load of work\nbut also a load of fun.\n\nCome hear the story of how this has happened, and come to learn how you\ncan be part of the greater Django information and communication\nmachinery.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python\nProgramming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring\ntogether students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python\nfrom around Australia, and all around the World.\n\nAugust 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia\n",
