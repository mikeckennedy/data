  "description": "Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate matrix expressions efficiently.\n\nTheano is used to build large-scale Machine Learning systems ---in particular Deep Learning Networks---and targets operations to GPU hardware, which achieves significant performance improvements over the same operations performed on a CPU (say using Numpy).\n\nIn this talk I will present an overview of the Theano library and introduce its main features using some simple examples.",
