  "description": "Easy command-line applications with cmd and cmd2\n\nPresented by Catherine Devlin (IntelliTech Systems)\n\nThe Python Standard Library's cmd module makes it absurdly simple to\nwrite command-line interpreters - non-graphical programs that\ncommunicate with users interactively through a simple text interface.\nThe third-party cmd2 module adds high-powered \"batteries\" to\napplications written for cmd.\n\nThis presentation teaches attendees how to easily make their own\npowerful command-line interpreters with cmd and cmd2. It also describes\nthe tricks cmd2 uses for some of its more interesting functionality so\nthat they can implement them in their own programs (even unrelated\nones). It ends with a brief demonstration of sqlpython, a cmd2-based\napplication that improves on existing ad-hoc SQL applications.\n",
