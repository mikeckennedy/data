  "description": "Scikit-Learn (http://scikit-learn.org/) is a well-known and popular\nframework for machine learning that is used by Data Scientists all over\nthe world. We show in a practical way how you can add your own estimator\nfollowing the interfaces of Scikit-Learn. First we give a small\nintroduction to the design of Scikit-Learn and its inner workings. Then\nwe show how easily Scikit-Learn can be extended by creating an own\nestimator. In order to demonstrate this, we extend Scikit-Learn by the\npopular and robust Theil-Sen Estimator\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil%E2%80%93Sen\\_estimator) that is\ncurrently not in Scikit-Learn. We also motivate this estimator by\noutlining some of its superior properties compared to the ordinary least\nsquares method (LinearRegression in Scikit-Learn).\n",
