  "description": "How to deploy ML Models as APIs without going nuts\n\nOften, the most convenient way to deploy a machine model is an API. It\nallows accessing it from various programming environments and also\ndecouples the development and deployment of the models from its use.\n\nHowever, building an good API is hard. It involves many nitty-gritties\nand many of them need to repeated every time an API is built. It\nrequires understanding of some web framework, worrying about data\nvalidation, authentication and deploying etc. Also, it is very important\nto have a client library so that the API can be easily accessed. If you\never plan to use it from Javascript directly, then you need to worry\nabout cross-origin-resource- sharing etc.\n\nIn this talk demonstrates how deploying machine learning models an APIs\ncan be made fun by using right programming abstractions and tools.",
