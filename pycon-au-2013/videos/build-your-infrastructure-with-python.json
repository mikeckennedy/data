  "summary": "Cloud computing is changing the way that businesses think about their\ncomputing requirements. Instead of ordering hardware, waiting for\ndelivery, allocating space in a data center, installing and wiring it\nup, and then configuring each piece of the system, you can now do the\nequivalent with a few clicks on a control panel, but that gets tedious.\nWhat's much more interesting is to do all of this programmatically,\nusing our favorite language: Python!\n\nThis session will deep-dive into this topic by using pyrax, the Python\nSDK for the OpenStack and Rackspace Clouds. It will cover the following:\n\n\u2022 Getting your cloud account and credentials\n\u2022 Installing pyrax\n\u2022 Creating servers\n\u2022 Saving a customized server as a template image\n\u2022 Creating more servers on demand from your template images.\n\u2022 Creating, attaching, and imaging Block Storage volumes.\n\u2022 Using private networks to create a bastion host setup\n\u2022 Managing these servers with a Load Balancer\n\u2022 Creating and managing Cloud Databases\n\u2022 Using pyrax to manage your DNS\n\u2022 Object storage and management using pyrax\n\n",
