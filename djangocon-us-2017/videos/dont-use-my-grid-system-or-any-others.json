  "description": "DjangoCon US 2017 - Don't Use My Grid System (or any others) by Miriam Suzanne\n\nI built Susy, a Sass grid system that can generate any grid technique you like \u2014 but I haven\u2019t used it in years. I\u2019ll show you how various grid systems work, and how to avoid using them. For those few cases where a grid really is required, we\u2019ll talk about the best ways to roll your own, so you\u2019re not relying on a bloated library to make decisions for you. We\u2019ll also look at the new layout toys, from flexbox to CSS Grid, and how to get started with only a few lines of code.\n\nWhen to use floats, CSS Grid, flexbox, custom properties, and other techniques.\n\nHow to make grid-math simple, and lose the grid-system.\n\nHow to make existing grid-systems work for you, when you\u2019re stuck with them.\n\nhttps://2017.djangocon.us/talks/don-t-use-my-grid-system-or-any-others/",
