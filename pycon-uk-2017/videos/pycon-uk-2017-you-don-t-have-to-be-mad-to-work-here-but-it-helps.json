Mental health concerns clearly exist within the Coding Community of which Python Community is part of and it's about time we talked about it in an honest and frank manner. We suffer from depression, anxiety, bipolar, ASD, self-harming, imposter syndrome and much, much more, but when it's all behind closed doors, everything becomes so much worse, so let's talk about our mental health and how we can help and support each other to cope when those little brain-gremlins yell abuse from our shoulder.",
