  "description": "Machine Learning has been getting a lot of buzz lately, and many\nsoftware libraries have been created which implement these routines.\nscikit-learn is a python package built on numpy and scipy which\nimplements a wide variety of machine learning algorithms, useful for\neverything from facial recognition to optical character recognition to\nautomated classification of astronomical images. This tutorial will\nbegin with a crash course in machine learning and introduce participants\nto several of the most common learning techniques for classification,\nregression, and visualization. Building on this background, we will\nexplore several applications of these techniques to scientific data --\nin particular, galaxy, star, and quasar data from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey -- and learn some basic astrophysics along the way. From these\nexamples, tutorial participants will gain knowledge and experience\nneeded to successfully solve a variety of machine learning and\nstatistical data mining problems with python.\n",
