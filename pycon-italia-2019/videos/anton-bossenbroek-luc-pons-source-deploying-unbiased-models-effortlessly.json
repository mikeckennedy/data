  "description": "For many organizations rapid machine learning deployment is often an\noxymoron. BCG Source provides a one-stop shop for data lineage and model\ndevelopment. We will demonstrate how easy deployment enables quick\ndiagnoses that a model is biased. Since it is essential to deploy\nunbiased machine learning, we will show how to remove this bias. You\nwill learn about common machine-learning and data-science pitfalls, how\nto easily deploy a machine learning model, how to spot bias and how to\nremove bias.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1808\n\nin \\_\\_on **Sunday 5 May** at 11:00 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
