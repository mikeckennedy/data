  "description": "``__slots__`` are versatile for certain kinds of uses and users, if you\nknow how they work.\n\nAt first glance, they seem like a free lunch, with improvements in both\ntime and space. At second glance, they seem to have so many caveats to\nmake them not worth using.\n\nThis talk is a deep dive into how ``__slots__`` work, how to wring every\nbenefit out, as well as the actual caveats and alternatives, with\nrecommendations for writers of core libraries as well as end users.\n",
