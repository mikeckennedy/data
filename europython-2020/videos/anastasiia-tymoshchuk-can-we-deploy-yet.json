  "description": "How to make your code production ready\n\nWhat happens when your features are done, your MVP is ready and you want to deploy your first production build? What do you do then? How do you make your first production build instead of re-using your development one? is your code ready to handle real user interactions?\r\nThis talk will show a production ready checklist for your Python code; what to look for when creating a production-ready Docker image; what are the differences between development and production environments and builds.\r\nYou will see how to deal with exceptions, logs, and metrics with real-world use cases.",
