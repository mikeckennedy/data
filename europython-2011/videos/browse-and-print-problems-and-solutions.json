  "description": "With the growth of the web, how we publish is changing. Paper alone is\nnot enough, web pages are also required. And for many web pages it is\nnot enough to rely on the browser\u2019s print capabilities. Sphinx, used\nsince 2008 for Python\u2019s documentation, is a creative response to this\ntension.\n\nThis talk will take a broader view of the problem. For example, many\nbrowsers support web fonts for display but not for printing. Mathematics\non web pages is still difficult, but SVG holds out much promise not only\nfor mathematics but for tables and other complex typeset material.\nAchieving accessibility remains difficult.\n\nBased on over 15 year\u2019s experience in print and electronic publishing,\nthis talk will survey problems and emerging solutions. Software and\nsites covered include LaTeX, PDF, SVG, MathJax, web-fonts, PediaPress,\nSphinx and arXiv.\n",
