  "description": "pandas allows you to sort a DataFrame by one of its columns (known as a \"Series\"), and also allows you to sort a Series alone. The sorting API changed in pandas version 0.17, so in this video, I'll demonstrate both the \"old way\" and the \"new way\" to sort. I'll also show you how to sort a DataFrame by multiple columns at once!\n\nThis is video 7 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
