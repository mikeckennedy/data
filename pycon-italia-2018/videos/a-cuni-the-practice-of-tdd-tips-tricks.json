  "description": "Test Driven Development is a well known practice in software\ndevelopment. However, passing from knowing the principles of TDD to\napplying them in real world situations is not straightforward: the aim\nof this talk is to help the audience to fill the gap and apply TDD\neffectively in Python. The talk will include:\n\n-  a brief overview of most popular tools and libraries (e.g. unittest,\n   pytest, nose, tox)\n-  useful design patterns\n-  common mistakes and how to avoid them\n-  some real life example taken from the projects the author has worked\n   on in the past 15 years (including PyPy, pdb++, capnpy)\n\nThis talk is primarily aimed at beginners.\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 20 April** at 11:00 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
