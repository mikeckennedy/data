  "description": "Looking for ways to make the transition from block based programming to\nPython easier, then look no further! In this talk 14 year old Josh will\nintroduce you to his project called EduBlocks, which is a drag and drop\nversion of Python 3 that he has created to help teachers introduce\nprogramming languages, like Python, to children at an earlier age. The\ngoal of the project is to make the transition from block based programs\nlike Scratch to Python easier for students and teachers, as presently\nthere is no drop-in solution that bridges this gap. Josh will share his\njourney so far with you, from how he came up with the idea when he was\nonly 11 years old, the developments along the way, the exciting plans\nfor the future and how schools today in over 72 different countries\naround the world are making use of EduBlocks on the Raspberry Pi and\nmicro:bit.\n",
