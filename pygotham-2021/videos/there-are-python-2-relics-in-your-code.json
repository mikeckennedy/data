  "description": "Should we return to Python 2? No? Then why don't you get rid of those Python\n2 relics from your code?\n\nMigration to Python 3 is over, but that's not the end of the journey.\nAlthough your code runs with the currently supported Python 3.6 to 3.9 (and\nupcoming 3.10), there may be some pieces of code that look obvious to you,\nbut may surprise younger developers who have never seen Python 2 code.\n\nEarlier this year, I helped dozens of Python projects on GitHub to get rid\nof those Python 2 relics. I'll show you a few recipes beyond the automatic\ntools, how to make your code modern and prepared for future updates.\n\nAnd no, we should not return to Python 2. We should get rid of it\ncompletely.",
