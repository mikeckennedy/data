  "summary": "Traditional solutions for data and graph analytics tend to be highly\nfragmented, and take the form of stand-alone frameworks. In this poster\nsession, we shall describe our approach that is centered around a suite\nof advanced parallel primitives embedded within SPM.Python. These\nprimitives augment the serial Python language with concepts like\nparallel generators, emitters and exceptions.\n",
