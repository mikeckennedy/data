  "description": "\"The Clock\" is a 2010 art installation by Christian Marclay. It is an\nexperimental film that features over 12,000 individual shots of clocks from\nmovies and television, edited in such a way that the film itself functions\nas a clock.\n\nIn this talk, we'll use modern machine learning models and video web\nscraping to recreate the concept behind \"The Clock\". We'll use Kubernetes to\norchestrate building a modern video scraper, capable of getting around the\nwalls of YouTube and Instagram to grab user content.\n\nWe\u2019ll then use existing machine learning models to infer when clocks occur\nin videos, to create our own montage with the found internet video.\n\nAlong the way, we'll learn how to build and monitor machine learning\nservices meant to scale from our local computers to hundreds of machines.",
