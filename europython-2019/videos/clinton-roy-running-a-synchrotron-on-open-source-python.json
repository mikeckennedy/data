  "description": "A synchrotron is a large research facility that has a large software\nstack to keep things running, fortunately a large chunk of the stack is\nOpen Source and fair chunk of it is Python to boot. By the end of the\ntalk attendees will understand the scale of the infrastructure (both\nphysical and software) that is required, and have an idea of what sort\nof problems a synchrotron could help them solve.",
