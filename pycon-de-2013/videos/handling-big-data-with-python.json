  "summary": "The talk gives a small introduction of how Blue Yonder applies machine\nlearning and Predictive Analytics in various fields as well as the\nchallenges of Big Data. Using the example of Blue Yonder's machine\nlearning software NeuroBayes, we show the made efforts and hit dead ends\nin order to provide a flexible and yet easy to use interface for\nNeuroBayes to Data Scientists. Since NeuroBayes is written in FORTRAN\nfor performance reasons different interface approaches were tried which\nlead us eventually to a Python interface. In the talk we elaborate on\nthe up- and downsides of the different approaches and the various\nreasons why Python won the race with an emphasize on the benefits of the\nPython ecosystem itself. Also, we discuss performance as well as\nscalability issues with Python and how we address them. In detail, we\nshow the application of Cython to speed up calculations in the Python\ninterface layer as well as distributed computing in a private cloud\ncalled Stratosphere. Scalability and efficiency is of utmost importance\nwhen data processing is time critical. Our overall goal is to give the\naudience an overview how Python fits in the software ecosystem of a\ncompany handling Big Data.\n",
