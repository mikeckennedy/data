  "abstract": "In the field of analytics, A/B testing is nowadays of the essence. A/B\ntesting is especially crucial to optimize business processes and user\nexperience -- Microsoft, Airbnb, Twitter, etc are building up huge teams\nfor their experimentation platforms.\n\nIn the talk, we will show our experiences of A/B testing at Zalando -- a\nGerman e-commerce company. Being the advantage of a large site, we\u2019ve\nalready run hundreds of tests, and we will share our learnings with you.\n\nMoreover, we will introduce our open-source Python library ExpAn. It is\ndeveloped for the statistical analysis of A/B testing and defines\nstandard data structures for statistical experiments. You can import it\neasily into your project and analyze your own A/B tests seamlessly. In\nthis talk, we will give a live coding session of using ExpAn.\n\nDepending on the time, we might also briefly mention some hot trends of\nresearch topics in A/B testing.\n",
