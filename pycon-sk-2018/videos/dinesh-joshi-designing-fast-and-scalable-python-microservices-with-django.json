  "description": "django, combined with the django REST framework, makes it very easy to\nbuild RESTful MicroServices. However, django is perceived to have some\noverhead making it hard to build fast and scalable MicroServices. This\ntalk shows you how to squeeze the last bit of performance from django.\nWe will focus on django\u2019s key architectural components and the right way\nto use them. Using profiling, we will identify bottlenecks and fix them\nenabling you to build scalable RESTful services that play to django\u2019s\nstrengths. At the end of the talk you will have a good handle on\nbuilding scalable MicroServices with django.\n",
