  "description": "Celery is an asynchronous task queue allowing easy distributed job\nexecution in Python. This talk will, after a short introduction to\nCelery, share what we learned when we used it as the backbone for the\ncampaign automation module of Exponea experience cloud. Serving over a\nhundred millions of our client's customers across the world with\nincredibly diverse use cases, we have heavily used some of Celery's most\nobscure functionality in often unintended ways. Join us for a bumpy ride\ntowards a stability and scalability and learn many insights useful if\nyou ever need to run some serious asynchronous jobs yourself. Barf bags\nnot included.\n",
