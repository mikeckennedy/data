  "description": "Open source projects face different problems at every level of their\ngrowth. For projects like CKAN success can be almost as frustrating as\nobscurity. A python backed open data platform, CKAN is used all over the\nworld to catalogue and distribute public data. The United Nations uses\nit, the Whitehouse uses it, governments large and small hire developers\nto customize and fine tune their installations. Why then does so little\nof that work make it back into CKAN core? This talk explores the\nproblems that mid-size open source projects face getting in-house\nprofessional developers to contribute back, and what project maintainers\ncan do to encourage those using their code to share their improvements.\n",
