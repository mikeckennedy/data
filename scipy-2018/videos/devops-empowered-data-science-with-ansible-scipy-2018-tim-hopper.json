  "description": "Many data scientists do a lot of work on computers besides their\nlaptops. For me, this often takes the form of SSH-ing into remote boxes\nand manually configuring the system with a combination of apt installs,\nConda environments, and bash scripts. In this talk I will introduce\nusers to Ansible scripts for replacing this manual effort with simple,\nreproducible, automated system configuration.Presenter(s): Speaker: Tim\nHopper, Cylance Inc.\n",
