    "description": "Speaker:: Sebastian Wanner Christopher Lennan\n\nTrack: PyData: Natural Language Processing\nIn this talk we will be presenting a case-study of how we used two open source libraries, Sentence-Transformers and Facebook Faiss, to successfully cluster offers at idealo.de based on text data. \r\n\r\nClustering text data is a well studied problem and we want to show how a state of the art approach succeeded in a business setting and how relatively easy it is to realise such a project with current open source tools. \r\n\r\nWe will present our Transformer based clustering approach in detail and compare its performance across different optimisation strategies (additive angular margin, contrastive, and triplet loss), as well as against other approaches, e.g. probabilistic record linkage.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/URDTCT\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
