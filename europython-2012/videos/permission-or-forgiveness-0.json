  "description": "Grace Murray Hopper\u2019s famous motto, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to ask forgiveness than\npermission\u201d, has many useful applications \u2013 in Python, in concurrency,\nin networking, as well of course as in real life. However, it\u2019s not\nuniversally valid. This talk explores both useful and damaging\napplications of this principle. I start by introducing the motto \u201cIt\u2019s\neasier to ask forgiveness than permission\u201d and the woman who used it,\nRear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, also known as the \u201cmother of Cobol\u201d\nand the author of the first ever programming-language compiler. I then\nmove on to the Python context, where the motto supports the proper usage\nof exception-catching rather than preliminary checks; and the \u201crule that\nproves the exception\u201d introduced by abstract base classes. Expanding the\nsubject, I show how \u201coptimistic concurrency\u201d applies that motto (while\nlocking would \u201cask permission\u201d, in essence, STM \u201casks forgiveness\"), and\nhow collision-detection focused networking protocols have similarly\ntriumphed over more highly structured, \u201cask permission\u201d ones like\ntoken-ring. Moving to the fuzzier context of real life, I then show how\nthis daring approach does not work quite as well as in the technical\nrealm \u2013 except when applied correctly, in the right circumstances\u2026 and I\ntry to evince a general law describing what the right circumstances for\nits application are, comparing and contrasting with the similar issue of\n\u201cdo it right the first time\u201d versus \u201claunch and iterate\u201d (and the\nlatter\u2019s cognate \u201cfail, but fail fast\u201d principle).\n",
