  "description": "**Audience level**\n\nExperienced\n\n**Description**\n\nCreating a custom search engine with python on google app engine. Serve\nlarge spikes in search request traffic. Allow students to find course\nreviews across multiple universities and countries.\n\n**Abstract**\n\n-  introduction to the real world problem - Students need to be able to\n   find university courses across multiple countries and universities.\n-  first - explore how to solve the problem - collect course data &\n   decide on a rough solution\n-  second - create minimum viable product & see how people use it.\n   Iteratively make it better.\n-  second continued: Organise a big website launch event before you've\n   created the website - then proceed to write 10K lines of code in the\n   week before launch.\n-  third - analyse the 50K most recent search terms & make a simple tree\n   data structure to help improve search performance.\n-  four - caching & cache invalidation\n-  five - Maybe I'll do an online marketing campaign halfway through the\n   talk and show graphs of the app responding in real time.\n\n-  Covers Data analysis with python (csv, matplotlib, networkx,\n   collections.Counter, logfile parsing)\n\n-  Covers \"Futures\" - doing RPC calls in parallel.\n-  Unit testing & simulating all things. - Being able to see how\n   adjusting search functionality effects query times & quality of\n   results.\n\n-  Some tasteful jokes to keep things entertaining ;)\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/robert-king-making-a-scalable-course-search-engine-with-python\n",
