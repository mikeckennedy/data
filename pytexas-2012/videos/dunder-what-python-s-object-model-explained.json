  "description": "Luke Lee is a full-time Python developer writing desktop GUI and scientific computing applications in the oil and gas industry. He is a regular member of the Houston Python and Django groups. After several years of writing embedded software in C for Solid State Disks, Luke jumped head first into the Python ecosystem. He came to Python for the whitespace and stuck with it for the community.\n\nPython's more advanced features like descriptors, context managers, and meta-programming can be more easily understood by investigating the object model and dunder methods. This talk will explore what dunder methods are, why their useful, and how they contribute to the overall design of a fully Pythonic object.",
