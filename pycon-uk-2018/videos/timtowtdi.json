Item\n  number 13 states: \u201cThere should be one \u2014 and preferably only one \u2014\n  obvious way to do it.\u201d\n| This talk discusses these apparently different philosophies. It\n  demonstrates that Python, like Perl, borrows features from other\n  languages. Contrary to Item 13, there is \u2014 and has always been \u2014 more\n  than one way to do it. Obviously.",
