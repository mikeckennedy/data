  "description": "As internet access reaches more and more people at what used to be the fringes of the technological world, we need to be sure that the web applications we build are also ready to reach users in these new environments. Assumptions that hold true in urban areas of developed countries often don't in rural or less developed areas, or those affected by conflict. In this talk, I'll be discussing some common issues and pitfalls that developers who usually work in established markets like Europe and North America encounter when writing applications for newer markets in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere. And, more importantly, what we as Django developers can do to overcome these challenges.",
