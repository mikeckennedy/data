  "description": "Do you have a stream of data that you would like to process in real\ntime? There are many components with Python APIs that you can put\ntogether to build a stream processing application. We will go through\nsome common design patterns, tradeoffs and available components /\nframeworks for designing such systems. We will solve an example problem\nduring the presentation to make these points concrete. Much of what will\nbe presented is based on experience gained from building production\npipelines for the real-time processing of ad streams at Yelp. This talk\nwill cover topics such as consistency, availability, idempotency,\nscalability, etc.\n",
