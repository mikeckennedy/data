  "description": "I will describe a pilot project at the University of California, Davis\non the redesign of an upper level mechanical vibrations engineering\ncourse where students now learn the relevant concepts via computational\nthinking and computational experimentation. We utilize interactive\ncomputing with the Jupyter platform and a custom Python library instead\nof focusing on the analytical mathematical methods used over the past\ncentury. I will cover the course design, principles of teaching and\nlearning with computational thinking (focusing on API design and the use\nof symbolics), software/hardware infrastructure, assessment practices,\nand lessons learned.Presenter(s): Speaker: Kenneth Lyons, University of\nCalifornia, Davis\n",
