  "description": "Rapid Python used on Big Data to Discover Human Genetic Variation\n\nPresented by Deniz Kural\n\nAdvances in genome sequencing has enabled large-scale projects such as\nthe 1000 Genomes Project to sequence genomes across diverse populations\naround the world, resulting in very large data sets. I use Python for\nrapid development of algorithms for processing & analyzing genomes and\ndiscovering thousands of new variants, including \"Mobile Elements\" that\ncopy&paste; themselves across the genome.\n\nAbstract\n\nRecent advances in high-throughput sequencing now enables accurate\nsequencing human genomes at a low cost & high speed. This technology is\nnow used to initiate projects involving large-scale sequencing of many\ngenomes. The 1000 Genomes project aims to sequence 2500 genomes across\n27 world populations, and has initially completed its Pilot phase. The\naim of the project is to discover & characterize novel variants. These\nvariants enable association studies that investigate the link between\ngenomic variation & phenotypes, including disease.\n\nA class of variants, known as \"Structural Variants\" represent a\nheterogenous class of larger variants, such as inversions, duplications,\ndeletions, and various kinds of insertions.\n\nI use Python to for rapid development of algorithms to process, analyze,\nand annotate very large data sets. In particular, I focus on Mobile\nElements, pieces of DNA that copy&paste; across the genome. These\nelements constitute roughly half of the genome, whereas protein-coding\ngenes account for roughly 1.5 % of the genome.\n\nI will discuss distributed computing, genomics, and big data within the\ncontext of Python.\n",
