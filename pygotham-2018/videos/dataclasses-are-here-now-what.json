  "description": "The PEP 557 dataclasses module is one of the new features added in Python 3.7 and are a decorator which generates the boiler-plate code needed by a data container class. In addition to providing access to stored data values by name, they provide a easy mechanism for including additional features such as default values and customized ordering.\n\nIn this talk we will explore dataclasses from a data container perspective by asking several questions.\n- How should one use dataclasses?\n- What functionality do dataclasses provide?\n- How do these features compare to existing data structures in the standard library like NamedTuple, and dict?\n- What about the third-party package attrs?\n- What are some additional features of dataclasses?\n- When might one want to use dataclasses?",
