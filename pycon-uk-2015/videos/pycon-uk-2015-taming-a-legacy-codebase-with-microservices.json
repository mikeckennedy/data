  "description": "This is a story of killing-off a legacy codebase written in PHP. To the\nbusiness, it \"just works\" and the customers love it. To the developers,\nit's an unmaintainable nightmare of bad practice that has resisted every\nattempt to rewrite from scratch.\n\nFrom the ashes of those doomed rewrites came a more incremental\napproach, finding areas in the code that could be extracted into small,\ncomposable services.\n\nI'll discuss why microservices are nothing new, how our approach\nevolved, the challenges of adoption, and the pros and cons of the\napproach. Although I won't delve too deeply into the technology stack,\nI'll doff my (metaphorical) hat to Django REST Framework and a few other\ntools of choice that have made the work possible.\n\nI hope to cut through the microservices hype, and illustrate one way of\nusing them to refactor, and ultimately replace, a legacy monolith.",
