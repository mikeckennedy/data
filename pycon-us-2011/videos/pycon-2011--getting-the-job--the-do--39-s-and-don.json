  "description": "Getting the job: the do's and don'ts of landing a Python job\n\nPresented by Brian Moloney\n\nEvery Python programmer is brilliant in his or her own way. That\nbrilliance shines in code and peer-to-peer conversation. But how do you\ndisplay your skills to a non-programmer? How do you impress management\nand human resources? What do you need to do (and not do) to successfully\nnavigate the hiring process and land the job?\n\nAbstract\n\nImaginary Landscape has been interviewing, hiring and not hiring Python\ntalent since 1999. Throughout these many years, there have been good\ncandidates, bad candidates and downright ugly candidates. This talk will\nuse actual correspondence and examples to demonstrate what can separate\nyou from the crowd and what can separate you from consideration.\nImaginary Landscape non- technical Managing Partner Brian Moloney will\nlead the session by describing how he evaluates potential hires and what\ngoes through his mind while speaking with potential Python candidates.\nAttendees will take away a specific set of guidelines for mastering the\nnon-technical aspects of the recruiting process.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: There are problems with the audio for the first 5\nminutes.]\n",
