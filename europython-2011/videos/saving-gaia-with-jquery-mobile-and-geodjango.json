  "description": "We had the privilege of working on a mobile web application for ETH\nZurich, funded by ETH North-South Centre, using Django/Postgis, jQuery\nmobile and Openlayers technology.\n\nIn this talk, I would like to share what we have learnt technically and\nthe experiences and fun we had with polygon creation on a map and saving\npolygon vertices and related data into our spatial database via\ngeodjango.\n\nThis mobile web app is developed based on research by Dr Koh of ETH\nZurich, specializing on Matrix-calibrated and edge-corrected\nspecies-area models that allow users to evaluate the biodiversity\nconsequence and trade-offs of land- use decisions. The development and\ndescription of these models were published in Conserv. Biol. 24, 994 and\nJ. Appl. Ecol. 47, 1063.\n",
