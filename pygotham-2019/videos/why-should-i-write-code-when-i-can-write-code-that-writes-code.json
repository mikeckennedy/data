  "description": "The temptation to employ code-generating techniques in Python is strong.\nMuch of what is called \"metaprogramming\" in Python refers to the various\ntechniques through which we can write higher-order code: code that then\ngenerates the code that solves our problem. This talk discusses various\ncommon approaches for code-generation, their applicability to solving real\nproblems, and the reality of using these techniques in your work.",
