  "description": "Talk: Software Defined Networking in Python\n\nSoftware Defined Networking (SDN) is currently a strong trend in telecommunications, strongly linked with virtualization. It allows splitting Control Plane from Data Plane. We will go through some theory and industry background. Then most popular SDN protocol - OpenFlow - will be introduced. We will see how to use it with Python frameworks such as POX.Experience with SDN will be useful for work in Telco networks as well as data centers. Basic knowledge of Python and Ethernet/IP networking is required.\n\nSpeaker: Konrad Gawda. Telecommunications specialist, graduated Warsaw University of Technology. Working with lab evaluation of new technologies and preparing prototypes of innovative telco solutions. Also - Python programmer and hobby electronics developer.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RYUK74DXm7PP6D6cJM8B8xwXIbj2adn7auhwwLOsH9o/edit?usp=sharing\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
