  "description": "Optimizations and Micro-Optimizations in CPython\n\nPresented by Mr. Larry Hastings\n\nCPython mostly gets faster from one version to the next. And when\nCPython gets faster, your programs get faster. This talk is a survey of\noptimizations made to CPython, recent and historical, large and small.\nAudience doesn't need to be familiar with CPython internals, but should\nbe familiar with Python and conversant in C.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Audio interference]\n",
