  "description": "The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is an open-source software package widely used in the geosciences to process and visualize time series and gridded data. Maps generated by GMT are ubiquitous in scientific publications in areas such as seismology and oceanography. We present a new GMT Python wrapper library built by the GMT team. We will show the design plans, internal implementations, and demonstrate an initial prototype of the library. Our wrapper connects to the GMT C API using ctypes and allows input and output using data from numpy ndarrays and xarray Datasets. The library is still in early stages of design and implementation and we are eager for contributions and feedback from the Scipy community.",
