  "description": "As developers we know (too well) there\u2019s no such thing as bug-free software.\nWhether you work in a small or big production software, incidents are\ninevitable and being prepared is key. How would you handle, for example, a\ndatabase outage if it happened now? Or a critical bug that is affecting half\nof your users?\n\nNavigating in crisis mode is never easy, but having a great company culture\nand recovery plan gives you guidance and mitigates damage. In this talk, I\nwill share some success cases, such as GitLab database outage recovery, and\nmy personal experience as a project manager overcoming a critical incident\nin a subscription system built with Django.\n\nWhat can you do to prepare your team? When should you enter crisis mode? How\nto assemble a recovery plan? To answer these and other questions, I will\nprovide a step-by-step guide, from an Modern Agile perspective, starting\nwith the bug discovery, and handling the client\u2019s expectations, through the\ndata recovery, until your incident postmortem.",
