  "description": "If you haven't tried multiprocessing or you are trying to move beyond\n``multiprocessing.map()``, you will likely find that using Python's\n``multiprocessing`` module can get quite intricate and convoluted. This\ntalk focuses on a few techniques (starting, shutting down, data flow,\nblocking, etc) that will maximize ``multiprocessing``\\ \u2019s efficiency,\nwhile also helping you through the complex issues related to\ncoordinating startup and *especially* shutdown of your multiprocess app.\n",
