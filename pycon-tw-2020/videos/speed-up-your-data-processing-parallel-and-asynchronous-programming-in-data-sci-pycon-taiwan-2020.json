  "description": "Day 2, R3 11:10\u201311:40\n\nConstantly waiting for your data processing code to finish executing? Through real-life stories, we will explore how to leverage on parallel and asynchronous programming in Python to speed up your data processing pipelines - so that you could focus more on getting value out of your data. While this talk assumes a basic understanding of processes in data pipelines and data science workflows, anyone with a basic understanding of the Python language would be able to understand the concepts and use cases illustrated with analogies.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/ongchinhwee/speed-up-your-data-processing-parallel-and-asynchronous-programming-in-python\n\nSpeaker: Chin Hwee Ong\n\nOng Chin Hwee is a data engineer, aspiring polymath and Industry 4.0 enthusiast who happens to be interested in things that fly (and stuff that burn to keep things flying). Hailing from a background in aerospace engineering and computational modelling, Chin Hwee has experience working on innovative projects in collaboration with academia and industry partners. Chin Hwee is a contributor to the documentation for pandas 1.0 and enjoys sharing her experiences at meetups and conferences.",
