  "description": "A successful data science project is one that results in implementation, e.g., putting a model into production or using the result to support an organizational change. But implementation is only partially a technical problem. Successful implementation depends on people. This talk will cover multi-level stakeholder analysis, and techniques for engagement from project scoping to delivery of results.",
