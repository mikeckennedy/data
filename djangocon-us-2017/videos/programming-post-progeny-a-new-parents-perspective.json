  "description": "DjangoCon US 2017 - Programming Post-Progeny: A New Parent's Perspective by Jacinda Shelly\n\nWhen my daughter appeared on the scene in 2017, my life was turned upside down.\n\nAs I was returning to work, I found that previous strategies for managing my time weren\u2019t up to snuff and I needed to create new ones if I was to be effective at my craft. No longer did I have 15 minutes to \u201cget in the zone\u201d - I needed to get things done in any time available. I learned to carve milestones out of minutes (sometimes) and will share what did (and didn\u2019t) work for me.\n\nI also share stories about my general journey of becoming a parent that may be helpful to anyone thinking about becoming a parent (or just wondering what it might be like!).\n\nOr you could just come to the talk for the cute baby pictures - they make everyone smile!\n\nhttps://2017.djangocon.us/talks/programming-post-progeny-a-new-parent-s-perspective/",
