  "description": "An introductory talk for anyone interested in learning what social network analysis is, and how to conduct their own network analysis using the Python package NetworkX (https://networkx.github.io/). In particular, I will focus on using character co-occurrences extracted from the scripts of Star Wars and will demonstrate how to build a directed network from them, calculate basic network metrics, and describe the relevance of each of these metrics in the context of our Star Wars dataset.",
