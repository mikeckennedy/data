  "description": "As I said in my DevFestCZ talk, most of the teenagers I know aren't interested in learning programming. We can probably blame the way programming is being taught. I think this should be changed and my programming teacher is a fantastic example of how to get kids excited about programming.\n\nIn this talk, I'll show you some good things that he does and I'll give you some tips that will help you rock too. I think you'll leave this talk with more ideas about how to teach teenagers programming in an interesting and effective way. This will be an interactive talk with a chance to ask questions and share your experience.",
