  "description": "Jupyter Notebooks provide a way to do \"literate computing\" where\ndocuments contain their own live code and visualizations. And while\ngetting started with notebooks is easy, using cloud-based hosting like\nAzure Notebooks makes it even easier to get started and share your\nresults. This talk will explain what notebooks are and talk about\nbenefits (and drawbacks) of hosting them in the cloud.\n\nBrett Cannon Bio\n----------------\n\nBrett is part of the `Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/>`__ Data\nScience Tools team at `Microsoft <https://www.microsoft.com/>`__ where\nhe works on various `Python\nengineering <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pythonengineering/>`__\nproblems. He has been a core developer of Python itself for over 13\nyears and mucked around with pretty much every part of Python at this\npoint. At this point Brett just hopes he can continue to live up to\n`winning the 2016 Frank Willison\nAward <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/05/brett-cannon-wins-frank-%20willison-award.html>`__.\n",
