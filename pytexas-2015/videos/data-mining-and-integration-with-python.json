  "description": "There is an abundance of data in social media sites (Wikipedia,\nFacebook, Instagram, etc.) which can be accessed through web APIs. But\nhow do we know that the data from the Wikipedia article on \"Golden Gate\nBridge\" goes along with the data from \"Golden Gate Bridge\" Facebook\npage? This represents an important question about integrating data from\nvarious sources.\n\nIn this talk, I'll outline important aspects of structured data mining,\nintegration and entity resolution methods in a scalable system.\n",
