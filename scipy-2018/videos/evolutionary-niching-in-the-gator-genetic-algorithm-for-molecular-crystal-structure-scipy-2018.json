  "description": "The goal of molecular crystal structure prediction (CSP) is to find all\nplausible polymorphs for a given molecule. This requires performing\nmultimodal global optimization over a high dimensional search space. To\ntackle this challenge, we have developed open-source, and massively\nparallel genetic algorithm package in Python called GAtor with fitness,\nselection, crossover, and mutation operators specifically designed for\nCSP, but GAtor\u2019s modularity allows our framework to be used for other\npurposes. We use descriptors for structural similarity and\nScikit-learn\u2019s Affinity Propagation and K-Means clustering algorithms in\na couple of different ways to effect niching and overcome local minimum\nentrapment.Presenter(s): Speaker: Timothy Rose, Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity Author: Farren Curtis, Carnegie Mellon University Author:\nXiayue Li, Google Author: Noa Marom, Carnegie Mellon University\n",
