  "description": "The Harry Potter series is an incredibly popular franchise that shaped a\ngeneration, but it\u2019s also been critiqued in the media and academics for\nits sometimes sexist portrayal of female characters. This talk uses\nNatural Language Processing techniques and Python to do the first\nquantitative analysis of gender bias in the language used to describe\nwomen and girls in the series, with a focus on Hermione Granger, the\nunsung hero of the story. Attendees will see techniques for reading and\nparsing large text files, leveraging grammatical rules to isolate the\nright words for the analysis, and data visualization techniques, using\nPython, the Natural Language Processing Toolkit (NLTK), and Matplotlib.\nAfter the talk, the audience will be able to get started on using the\n\u201cmagic\u201d of programming to isolate biased language in any piece of text.\n",
