  "description": "Many people think of Linear Algebra as intimidating, difficult, and great for ending conversations at parties. The truth is that Linear Algebra is extraordinarily useful, often unreasonably so. By studying one equation, y = Ax, you will add an arsenal of tools and intuition to your skillset that can be applied in any technical situation (even nonlinear ones).",
