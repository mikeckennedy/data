  "description": "Privacy and security are key parts of Mozilla's mission, and we build\nsome of the largest Django applications on the web, so being at the\nabsolutely forefront of security is crucial to us. And having a great\nuser experience is, too. So over the past few years, we've developed a\nnumber of proposals, tools --like Bleach and django-ratelimit--and best\npractices, and we've wrapped these up into our application template\nPlaydoh and an app called Funfactory.\n\nI'll share those best practices and their motivations. We'll also go\nover a number of tools, settings, and even some fairly new web standard\nproposals (with tools, of course) to help you build the most secure\nDjango applications you can, at whatever scale you're building.\n",
