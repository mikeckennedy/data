  "description": "Camelot is a Python framework that leverages SQLAlchemy and QT to build\nrich desktop applications. The model - view definition used was inspired\nby the Django Admin interface. Some see it as a replacement for MS\nAccess, but it's underlying libraries allow much more advanced features.\n\nIn this talk we will focus on the changes and new features that were\nintroduced in Camelot and more importantly, how they can be used in your\napplications. Those features range from Matplotlib chart integration and\nnew types of actions to displaying custom SQLAlchemy queries in a table\nview.\n\nWe will share our experiences with large scale deployment of Python and\nCamelot applications to the desktop of the user. In a number of case\nstudies we will point out the mistakes we made and how they were\ncorrected.\n",
