  "description": "You'll get a short overview of the Scientific Computing ecosystem in\nPython and what kind of problems it can be applied to.\n\nIn recent years, Python's scientific stack has emerged as a serious open\nsource alternative to established proprietary systems like MATLAB or\nspecialized solutions like R. However, the wide range of packages and\noptions is often confusing for inexperienced users - this talk aims to\nprovide a remedy.\n\nIn particular, you'll learn about:\n\n-  Why Scientific Computing with Python? (Motivation)\n-  What is it the scientific stack has to offer? (Interesting\n   packages/libraries)\n-  Who is using it? (Companies/applications working with Python's\n   scientific stack)\n-  How can I start? (Scientific Python distributions)\n-  Is it really that simple? (Yes! Showcases)\n",
