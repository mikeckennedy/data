  "description": "Descriptors are often not that common to be found, compared to other\nidioms (decorators, context managers, etc.). However, they provide a\npowerful tool for improving our code, by enabling us to encapsulate\nlogic into different objects transparently.\n\nThe talk will cover the descriptor protocol, different types of\ndescriptors, and some examples where descriptors shine, yielding a\nvery elegant and efficient solution.",
