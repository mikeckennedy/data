  "description": "There is a scenario that is quite common when doing data science at scale.\nThe Data Science team have developed a good algorithm that suits our purpose and the prototype works well on a test dataset. But how to transform it into a reliable, responsive service ready for production payload? We will got through the steps involved in the evolution of a Jupyter notebook into an auto-scaling service. These steps involve changes in data ingestion, asynchronous processing, dockerisation, kubernetes and cloud technologies.",
