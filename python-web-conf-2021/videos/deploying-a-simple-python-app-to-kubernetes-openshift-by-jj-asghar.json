  "description": "\"Deploying A Simple Python App to Kubernetes/OpenShift\" by: JJ Asghar\n\nJJ will walk you through deploying a simple python application to Kubernetes/OpenShift. We\u2019ll start from the ground up, then get a complete automated build. The goal is to enable your developers to focus on code, not the infrastructure! It\u2019s a chance to see the power of OpenShift and why taking the time to learn cloud native development can get you the velocity you need.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
