  "description": "Observability is often thought of as just a new word for monitoring.\nWhile it encompasses traditional devops areas such as monitoring,\nmetrics, and infrastructure management, it\u2019s much deeper and empowers\ndevelopers at all levels of the stack. **Observability is about\nachieving a deep understanding of your software**. This not only helps\nyou localize and debug production issues but removes uncertainty and\nspeculation, **empowering developers** to know their tools and improving\nengineering excellence. Observability helps developers \u201cunderstand the\nnarrative\u201d of what\u2019s going on in their software.\n\nThis talk is about how we\u2019ve driven adoption of a culture of\nobservability within our engineering culture. We'll define and motivate\nfor our focus on observability; discuss the tangible tools we\u2019ve built\nand best practices we\u2019ve adopted to ingrain observability into our\nengineering culture; and provide some specific, real-world results we\u2019ve\nachieved as part of this effort. We'll will focus particularly on the\ntooling we\u2019ve adopted around Django and Celery and some interesting\nexperiences we had extending their internals.\n",
