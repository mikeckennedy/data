  "description": "Carina works at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) where she is a software engineering team lead. It is her mission to improve the software quality at the DLR. But why is this necessary? After all we went to the moon with less computer power than of a modern smartphone! While there are a lot of success stories, there are also those stories where software failures resulted in mission failures.\n\nThis talk gives an overview of some of these unfortunate programming errors, their consequences, and how modern developement tries to prevent history from repeating.",
