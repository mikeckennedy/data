  "description": "What if Python created your slides for you?\n\nWhat if it could create animations in PowerPoint that are not humanly\npossible to match in terms of fineness, accuracy or richness?\n\nThat's what this session aims to do. And to answer the inevitable\nquestion \"But why PowerPoint?\" all I have to say is: once you remove\nPowerPoint's user interface, the underlying canvas and rendering engine\nis as flexible as SVG or Inkscape.\n\nPlus, corporates love paying for stuff like this.",
