  "description": "The next generation of Genetic Engineering is the ability to design and make synthetic genes - the DNA of all living organisms. This is used across multiple industries, like pharma, agriculture, chemical production and even data storage. Twist Bioscience developed disruptive technology to synthesize DNA and its Israel R&D center develops software tools to design and debug DNA sequences by its customers. Yogev will describe the challenges, technology and application of the next generation of Genetic engineering, led by Nano-technology and Software.",
