  "description": "Functional programming offers a different approach to data and program\nstructure. Originally a domain of academic institutions, however,\nnowadays it is getting used more and more, particularly thanks to its\nusefulness in distributed systems. Examples of functional properties in\ncode include: usage of immutable variables, recursion, pattern matching\nor higher-order functions, which are not always easy to understand for a\nbeginner. In this talk, we will introduce some of the functional\nprogramming properties and their usage in Python.\n",
