  "description": "Over the last 10 years, Luke Lee has professionally written software for applications ranging from Python desktop and web applications to embedded C drivers for Solid State Disks. Currently, he writes scientific Python applications for Blueback Reservoir in Houston, TX. His enthusiasm for Python is emphasized throughout his presentations at several Python related conferences including Pycon, PyTexas, and PyArkansas. He is also an active member of the Houston Django and Python user groups.\n\n\nPython has a large collection of tools for scientific computing. However, finding the right pieces and assembling them into a fast and scale-able app can be a daunting task. This talk will explore common requirements of scientific apps and how to fulfill those from the Python ecosystem. It will also provide a blueprint for building apps using tools like PyQt, PyQwt, numpy, and HDF5.",
