  "summary": "There are few feelings more sweet than being a web-app backend\ndeveloper, and knowing that the vaguaries and frustrations of front-end\ndesign, Javascript inconsistencies, and web-browser quirks are \"Someone\nElse's Problem\".\n\nThe backend developer, instead, has just three goals: Make the system\nlightning fast and infinitely scalable; ensure its absolute security and\nimpregnability; and guarantee its absolute correctness, stability, and\ngeneral perfection in the face of all input at all times.\n\nI'll take that over having to debug CSS rendering quirks any day of the\nweek.\n\nIn this talk I'll cover these three goals and how Django helps make each\none achievable, including a tour of some of the lesser known features of\nthe framework, such as:\n\n-  Magic tricks you can do with Django's caching framework beyond the\n   naive \"cache this page\", and its ability to take advantage of the\n   browser's own cache in marvellous ways.\n-  Taking Django's testing framework to its logical (and illogical)\n   extremes. Including clever uses of selenium and webdriver to run unit\n   tests, integration tests and even Javascript tests.\n-  Considerations of Django use and web security. Including the sorts of\n   things Django does a great job of protecting you from, and the things\n   where your own due dilligence will always be required.\n\n",
