  "description": "In Red Hat, our corporate culture is a very important topic and a focal point for our senior leadership as well as for all of our more than 11,000 Red Hatters globally. As a company built on opensource, our culture includes values such as meritocracy, openness, transparency and diversity. Our culture is what differentiates Red Hat from our large corporate competitors. \nBut how to preserve this culture and continue growing? How to incorporate diversity and benefit from inclusion? What activities is Red Hat doing in order to balance fun with productivity? And how to convert buzzwords like openness, leadership and meritocracy into real actions? In my session, I will provide answers to these questions using cases from Red Hat Czech and Red Hat global and also discuss any related topic brought up by the audience.",
