  "description": "How Python can be used to create and educate\n\n| How I went from knowing nothing about computer programming, to\n  creating maker projects and a raising an income using Python as my\n  main language.\n| Learn what worked well for me, and the failures along the way so YOU\n  can take that first step to becoming a maker with Python.\n| I will also talk about outreach in schools and clubs that is much\n  needed for the next generation of Pythonistas.",
