  "description": "This talk will present a new approach to dimension reduction called\nUMAP. UMAP is grounded in manifold learning and topology, making an\neffort to preserve the topological structure of the data. The resulting\nalgorithm can provide both 2D visualisations of data of comparable\nquality to t-SNE, and general purpose dimension reduction. UMAP has been\nimplemented as a (scikit-learn compatible) python library that can\nperform efficient dimension reduction, scaling out to much larger\ndatasets than t-SNE or other comparable algorithms (see\nhttp://github.com/lmcinnes/umap).Presenter(s): Speaker: Leland McInnes,\nTutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing\n",
