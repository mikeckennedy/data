  "description": "Messaging is a well established domain in information technology and can\ngreatly improve the scalability and throughput of a system when employed\nappropriately. Message queues can be used to achieve\n\n-  spatial decoupling i.e. the systems that produce and consume messages\n   may be deployed on different machines, networks, continents etc.\n-  temporal decoupling i.e. a system can enqueue a message and carry on\n   without waiting for the message consumer.\n\nWe use e.g. messaging in `OpenQuake <http://openquake.org>`__ to\ndistribute calculations of `seismic\nhazard <http://openquake.org/about/gem/>`__ and the respective risk to\nhuman lives and infrastructure.\n\nThere is a huge number of messaging patterns identified in the\n`industry <http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321200683/>`__ and a small\nselection of these will be presented to whet your appetite :-)\n\n`AMQP <http://www.amqp.org/>`__ is a fairly new and open messaging\nstandard with a number of freely available open source message brokers\n(`RabbitMQ <http://www.rabbitmq.com/>`__,\n`ZeroMQ <http://www.zeromq.org/>`__, `qpid <http://qpid.apache.org/>`__\netc.) with different features and performance trade-offs.\n\nIn the course of the presentation you will be - introduced to AMQP\nconcepts and jargon - introduced to available Python AMQP bindings\n(focussing on an asynchronous\n(`txAMQP <https://launchpad.net/txamqp>`__) and a synchronous variant\n(most likely `kombu <http://ask.github.com/kombu/>`__) - shown code\nexamples demonstrating how to use these Python bindings\n\nThe presentation (45 minutes in total) is structured as follows:\n\n-  7.5 minutes for messaging concepts and patterns\n-  7.5 minutes for AMQP concepts\n-  5 minutes for an overview of the Python bindings for AMQP\n-  10 minutes for txAMQP examples (asynchronous bindings)\n-  10 minutes for kombu examples (synchronous bindings)\n-  5 minutes for questions\n\nReferences:\n\n-  http://www.amqp.org/\n-  http://www.rabbitmq.com/\n-  http://www.zeromq.org/\n-  http://qpid.apache.org/\n-  https://launchpad.net/txamqp\n-  http://ask.github.com/kombu/\n-  http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321200683/\n\n",
