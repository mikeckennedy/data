  "description": "Data Scientists (or researchers) often do many early-stage prototyping\nand run many experiments before finding the optimal solution for the\nproblem they are trying to solve. However, sometimes, a lot of the\nknowledge gained in the process stays with the person. In this proposed\ntalk, I would like to introduce how to produce, share and ensure the\nreproducibility of experiments using jupyter notebooks and github. This\nis a series of lessons Iearned while being a research student (where\nopen-sourcing the code and data used to generate papers is very\nimportant) and more recently, working in a new team in Zalando, where we\nhave experimented with different ways to share and review the data\nscience tasks, as well as the knowledge generated from those tasks.\n",
