  "summary": "The continual decrease in the cost of computer hardware is allowing more\nembedded systems to be built with Linux and Python, instead of the\ntraditional approach of a real-time operating system and C. This talk\nreviews the differences between those approaches and describes problems,\nsolutions, and tools that can be used when building embedded systems\nwith Python.\n",
