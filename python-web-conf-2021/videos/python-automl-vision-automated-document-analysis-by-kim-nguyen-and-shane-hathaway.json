  "description": "\"Python + AutoML Vision = Automated Document Analysis\" by: Kim Nguyen and Shane Hathaway\nGoogle\u2019s AutoML Vision service is a great new tool. A client of ours had a time intensive process for classifying and routing documents. Using AutoML and Python, we helped them prototype and deploy a machine learning model to reduce the frequency of errors and accelerate overall processing of thousands of documents a day. We will describe the solution and present lessons learned.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
