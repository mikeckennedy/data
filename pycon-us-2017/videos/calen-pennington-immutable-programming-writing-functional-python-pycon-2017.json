  "description": "The world of Haskell and functional programming may seem like a distant\nplace to many working Python developers, but some of the techniques used\nthere are remarkably useful when developing in Python.\n\nIn this talk, I will cover some of the pitfalls of mutability that you\nmay run into while writing Python programs, and some tools and\ntechniques that Python has built in that will let you avoid them. You'll\nsee namedtuples, enums and properties, and also some patterns for\nstructuring immutable programs that will make them easier to build,\nextend, and test.\n",
