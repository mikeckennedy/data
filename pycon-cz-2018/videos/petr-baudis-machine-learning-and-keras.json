  "description": "What is needed for machines to automatically teach themselves to make decisions based on examples? Machine Learning is all the rage nowadays and may seem very magical, especially on \u201cunstructured data\u201d like texts, pictures or sounds.\n\nBut what is actually a \u201cneural network\u201d and do you need a PhD to build some? Turns out that machine learning models are far less magical than they seem to be (at least when solving the more common tasks). Even if your program will acquire magic powers in the eyes of your users.\n\nWe will unveil the dark secret of how neural networks actually look inside. And to solve two real problems (related to text and pictures), we will actually build a couple of simple ones in the popular Python framework Keras.",
