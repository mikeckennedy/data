  "description": "Python has a great reputation as a cross-platform language, which for\nmany people means different varieties of Linux. But a huge number of\nPython users are running on Windows - a fundamentally different\noperating system where things do not always work the same. However,\nPython has always worked incredibly well across different platforms\nincluding Windows, going to great lengths to support and expose the\nplatform without making development more complex. In this session,\nCPython core developer and Microsoft engineer Steve Dower will discuss\nsome of the reasons why cross-platform support is not an accident, and\nhow Python 3.6 makes it even easier to support both Windows and Linux.\n",
