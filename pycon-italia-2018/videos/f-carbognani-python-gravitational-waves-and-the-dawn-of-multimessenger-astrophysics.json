  "description": "Following a multi-year upgrade programme and several months of\ncommissioning, the Advanced Virgo detector joined the LIGO Observation\nRun 2 (O2) data-taking period on the 1st of August 2017. On August 14,\nAdvanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detected the first triple-coincident\nmerger of a binary black hole system, demonstrating the best-ever\nlocalization of gravitational-wave source on the sky. Three days later,\nthe same detectors recorded for the first time the signal from a merger\nof a binary neutron star system. Counterparts of the event were also\nobserved in all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. This represents\nthe first time that a cosmic event has been viewed in both gravitational\nwaves and light and marks the beginning of multimessenger astrophysics.\nIn this talk I will present an overview on the Advanced Virgo detector\nfocusing on the role that it has played in this stream of discoveries\nand on the challenges we are still facing on the current upgrade and\ncommissioning phases. I will also provide a general overview on the\ndifferent uses of Python within the Virgo Projects highlighting its\ncurrent use for the detector supervisory control automation, slow sample\nrate data acquisition and control room user interfaces development.\n\nin \\_\\_on **sabato 21 aprile** at 09:00 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
