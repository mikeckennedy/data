  "summary": "R has become hard to avoid when working with data; there is hardly a\nmethod in statistics or visualization that is not available, and there\nare many methods that are originally only available in R.\n\nThe Python-to-R bridge opens the whole library of R functions, classes,\nand datasets to the Python programmer by exposing an embedded R process\nand its objects through a Python library.\n",
