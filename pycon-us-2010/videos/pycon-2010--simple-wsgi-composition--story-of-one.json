  "description": "Simple WSGI composition: story of one refactoring\n\nPresented by Max Ischenko\n\nStory of a refactoring I did to split one big, monolithic Pylons app\ninto a bunch of smaller ones, using power of WSGI and nginx. The devil\nis in the details: how to handle common auth, site-wide look and feel,\ncommon utilities, database management. Pros and cons of the approach,\npossible alternatives.\n\nThe talk assumes listeners know what WSGI is and preferably have used\nsome WSGI-centered framework like Pylons, Werkzeug, Paste or other.\n\nThe application this talk describes powers developers.org.ua.\n",
