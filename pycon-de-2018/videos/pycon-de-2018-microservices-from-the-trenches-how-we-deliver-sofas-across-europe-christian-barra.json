  "description": "At made.com we use micro-services written in Python to power our entire\nbackend system and deliver an incredible amount of orders each week.\nDuring this presentation I will explain what are micro-services and\ncompare them to monolith applications. By analysing what are the\ndifferences between micro- services and monolith applications I will\nshow why you need them and for which situations they are extremely\nuseful. I will also talk about what you need on different levels\nregarding infrastructure, knowledge and experience to get the most out\nof a micro-services architecture. The last part of the presentation is\ndedicated to the drawbacks of running a micro-services architecture and\nsharing some solutions. I will conclude sharing some useful resources\nabout micro services and taking some questions.\"\n",
