  "description": "Quantum physics is notoriously tricky, but if you have some coding\nability, exploring quantum systems is extremely easy. The discrete time\nquantum walk is the quantum analogue of the classical random walk, and\nwas developed in the hope of it having algorithmic applications. In\nfact, the model is universal for quantum computation, and famous\nalgorithms such as Grovers' (quantum search) can be described in terms\nof it.\n\nI will describe the code for a quantum walk on a 2d lattice, and\nindicate how this code can be used and adapted to address open research\nquestions in the field of quantum information.\n\nAs well as describing in detail how to simulate quantum walks, I will\ngive a brief introduction in general to simulating quantum systems, the\nsorts of things you look for if investigating them numerically, and the\nsuitability in general of using simulation as a tool for researching\nphysics. After making it look ridiculously easy, I will describe the\nchallenges faced by people investigating quantum systems numerically,\nand other reasons why we need quantum computers.\n",
