  "description": "Have you ever wanted to write a GUI application in Python that you can\nrun on both your laptop and your phone? Have you been looking to\ncontribute to an open source project, but you don't know where to start?\n\nBeeWare is a set of software libraries for cross-platform native app\ndevelopment from a single Python codebase and tools to simplify app\ndeployment. The project aims to build, deploy, and run apps for Windows,\nLinux, macOS, Android, iPhone, and the web. It is native because it is\nactually using your platform's native GUI widgets, not a theme, icon\npack, or webpage wrapper.\n\nThis talk will teach you how Toga, the BeeWare GUI toolkit, is\narchitected and then show you how you can contribute to Toga by creating\nyour own GUI widget in five easy steps.\n",
