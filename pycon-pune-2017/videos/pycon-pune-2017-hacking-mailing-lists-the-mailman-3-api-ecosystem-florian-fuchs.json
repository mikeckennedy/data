  "description": "Mailman, the well-known and trusted Mailing list manager, introduced a\nnumber of APIs in version 3.0 that make it a much more modular system\nthan previous versions. These APIs can be used to manage your Mailman\ninstance and to access mailing list posts as they travel through the\nsystem. This talk is an introduction to those APIs and how you can use\nthem to integrate Mailman 3 into your own applications and integrate it\nwith your own business processes and systems.\n\n\nIn this talk you will learn:\n\n-  About Mailman 3\u2019s basic architecture and which LMTP-, REST- and\n   Python-based APIs are available\n-  How Mailman 3 uses its APIs internally for its management web UI\n   (Postorius) and archiver (HyperKitty)\n-  How you can use Mailman 3\u2019s REST API to programatically create new\n   lists, subscribe users, change settings and preferences and much more\n-  How you can access list posts for further processing before they\n   leave the system\n-  Learn about some interesting new sub projects that use and enhance\n   these APIs\n\nI\u2019ll sprint on Mailman at the developer sprints - come hack with me!\n",
