  "description": "(Paco Nathan) Graphs are amazing: there's the emerging graph ML work in deep learning, the rise of knowledge graphs in industry, powerful graph algorithms, ginormous graph databases, interactive graph visualizations, and so on. While these might seem to require special platforms and specialized expertise, in fact there's so much that can be done with graph-based technologies in Python. A team of open source developers has been working on [`kglab`](https://github.com/DerwenAI/kglab) to integrate many different libraries related to graph work into an abstraction that plays well with popular data science tools in Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Parquet, spaCy, PyTorch, RAPIDS, etc. This session will introduce _Graph Data Science_, showing how you can leverage these techniques into your data analytics work.\n\nhttps://2021.pycon.org.au/program/UTHCXW/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country\u2019s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 13:30:00 2021 at Science, Data & Analytics",
