  "description": "A look at the GPIO Zero library for Raspberry Pi yields the blueprint\nfor a Pythonic API for programming the behaviour of interconnected\ndevices.\n\nGPIO Zero provides a multi-paradigm programming interface to GPIO\ndevices: - procedural (polling) - procedural (blocking) - event-driven\n(callbacks) - declarative\n\nStart with simple scripts to control LEDs and buttons on a breadboard,\nlearn to prototype ideas and move on to declaring interaction between\nmore advanced devices in the home and beyond.\n\nThese options for device programming, along with the extensibility of\nthe library, provide the means to program complex behaviour using simple\nPythonic code.\n",
