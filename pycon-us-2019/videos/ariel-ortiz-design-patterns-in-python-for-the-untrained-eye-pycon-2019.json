  "description": "Design patterns are prepackaged solutions to common software design\nproblems. We get two important benefits when using them. Firstly, we get\na way to solve typical software development issues by using a proven\nsolution. Secondly, we get a shared vocabulary that allows us to\ncommunicate more effectively with other software designers. Getting\nacquainted with design patterns is the next step to become a better\nobject oriented programmer.\n\nIn this tutorial we'll answer some of the most important questions\nsurrounding design patterns: What are they? How can we use them in our\nprograms? When should we avoid them? We'll also have the opportunity to\nexplore and play with the Python implementations of some of the\nclassical design patterns made famous by the Gang of Four (Gamma, Helm,\nJohnson & Vlissides) while learning relevant design principles at the\nsame time. Don't forget to bring your own laptop with your preferred\nPython 3 development environment.\n",
