  "description": "Python is a booming language in the United States and finds itself\nintegrated in practically every discipline involving software\nengineering. When new resources come out for us to develop better or\nfaster we tend to forget that we build products for people who aren\u2019t\nlike us or who aren\u2019t in situations like us. This is especially true of\nthe web. In this talk, we will discuss how to increase our web apps\naccessibility through handy techniques and tools and how you can make\nuse of the features of web frameworks like Flask or Django to make\nanyone coming to our spot on the Internet a bit more pleasant for\neveryone without it costing much more time.",
