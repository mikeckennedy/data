  "description": "PostgreSQL is an advanced, versatile open-source database management\nsystem that integrates perfectly with Python. It is developed by a very\nactive international community and is distributed under the BSD-like\nPostgreSQL License.\n\nEnterprise-class features (including SQL standard compliance, ACID\ntransactions, disaster recovery, high availability, replication,\npartitioning and general extensibility) make PostgreSQL suitable for\nbusiness critical environments seeking to reduce the TCO of their\ndatabase solutions without altering their functional needs. PostgreSQL\n9.0, released in September 2010, was the first version of PostgreSQL\nwith Hot Standby, a built-in master/slave replication mechanism.\nAsynchronous replication through the standard and consolidated log\nshipping technique (previously used with Warm Standby for high\navailability) has been enhanced with streaming replication.\n\nVersion 9.1, expected to be out later in 2011, will add synchronous\nreplication to PostgreSQL, making it the first DBMS that allows\ndevelopers and users to control the replication strategy at\ntransactional granularity. Come to the talk and discover all the major\nnew features of PostgreSQL 9.1, including extensions management,\nwritable common table expressions (WCTE), etc.\n",
