  "description": "In this session you will get a gentle introduction to the ever-expanding world of small programmable devices: learn to use tiny microcontrollers to connect to sensors and talk to APIs - all using MicroPython, a subset of Python 3 for use in constrained environments.\n\nYou will be introduced to the basics of physical computing and the joys (and some of the pains) of writing Python code for devices that weigh less than a piece of chewing gum but still have the power to communicate with web APIs, act as wireless access points, even host a small web server, and more.",
