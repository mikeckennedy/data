  "description": "My goal is to share resources, pedagogy, best practices and lessons\nlearned in bringing hands-on coding workshops to underserved K-12\nstudents.\n\nFor fall 2017 over ten weeks, `Code Park Houston`_, a a 501(c)(3)\nnon-profit organization piloted a free after-school Creative Coding\nprogram at `BakerRipley - Leonel Castillo \\| BakerRipley`_. We focused\non **Coding as Enrichment** by encouraging our students to pursue\ncreative endeavors such as storytelling with Minecraft and making\nprocedural art with `p5.js \\| get started`_. Instead of traversing a\nprogramming language\u2019s syntax peculiarities, our students drew colorful\nlines, made interactive buttons, and shared their creations.\n\nWe also worked to provide a positive and collaborative learning\nenvironment. Our students were encouraged to learn by making mistakes\nand exploring his or her own interests. In the process, we just happened\nto facilitate knowledge in coding, problem-solving, electronics science\nand collaboration.\n\nWhen it comes to technology, the arts can be an unusual pathway to\nsuccess. But we know and see that creativity is the secret sauce that\ninspires the next generation of diverse and passionate students.\n\nThis program was a rewarding experience for everyone involved. We faced\nand overcame many challenges. For the talk I would like to share:\n\n**Tools of the Trade**\u200a\u2014\u200awhat software and hardware we used and why.\n**Classroom Set Up**\u200a\u2014\u200ahow to provide a positive and encouraging\nlearning environment. **Best Practices for Tech Educators**\u200a\u2014\u200awhy we are\nlearning facilitators. **Open Source Creative Coding Curriculum**\u200a\u2014\u200aopen\nsource curriculum to be used in your own classroom!\n\n.. _Code Park Houston: https://codeparkhouston.org/\n.. _BakerRipley - Leonel Castillo \\| BakerRipley: https://www.bakerripley.org/locations/leonel-castillo-community-center\n.. _p5.js \\| get started: https://p5js.org/get-started/",
