  "description": "For many years, I had entirely given up on ever understanding the slightest thing about cryptography. The amount required to understand even the most basic part seemed entirely dazzling. However, I\u2019ve since learned it\u2019s not nearly as hard as I thought to understand many of the important concepts.And this is what I want to share with you.\n\nFor this talk, you don\u2019t need to know anything about cryptography, and almost no math knowledge. You\u2019ll gain an understanding of what the different components are and how they interact. And learn to get a grasp of how a system works, without necessarily understanding the details of each individual part.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll take you through some of the underlying design principles of modern applications of cryptography. We\u2019ll talk about what we\u2019re trying to accomplish, which parts are involved, and how to prevent and understand common vulnerabilities. This will help you to make better choices when you implement cryptography in your products and will improve your understanding of how crypto is applied to things you already use.",
