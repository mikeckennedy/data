  "summary": "Python includes a powerful debugger, but using it well requires\npractice. Setting a break point and inspecting local variables is easy,\nbut what else can you do? What if you need to set the breakpoint in one\nof your dependencies, or only fire it conditionally? How do you navigate\ncalls, or change them? Join me for an in depth look at how you can\nbetter use PDB to debug and understand programs.\n",
