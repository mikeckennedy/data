  "description": "Talk: Modern Deployments\n\nDeploying your application is a critical part of your getting things done pipeline.Still, making your beautiful creation publicly available can become a messy process full of nightmares you -- or your infrastructure team -- wish were never there.Instead of fearing it, embrace early and often deployments, assisted by tools that help you develop and scale your apps. This talk is a demo of how to deploy Python-based web applications using the open-source PaaS OpenShift, that relies on cool modern technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.\n\nSpeaker: Rodolfo Carvalho. Rodolfo is a long time Pythonista coming from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He founded the Coding Dojo Rio, a successful effort to share knowledge and build a community. His curiosity and avidity has taken him to visit several cities, and live in Lisbon, Beijing, Cracow and now Brno. He currently works on OpenShift, the open-source PaaS from Red Hat.\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/rhcarvalho/python-deployments-on-openshift-3\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
