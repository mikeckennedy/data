  "description": "When working with MongoDB, especially if you are coming from (or\nconverting an application) the SQL world, you will probably miss the SQL\ntransaction, which gives you, among other things, atomic writes. MongoDB\nonly provides atomic writes to one document. We will show you how you\ncan implement multi-document writes that are, if all writers cooperate,\nconsistent across multiple documents and either writes all changes\ncompletely or fail without writing any changes. Audience: People who are\nlooking at SQL alternatives, but still need some sort of\ntransaction-like consistency. Understanding of parallellism issues, race\nconditions and deadlocks, may be helpful. MongoDB knowledge is not\nneeded. Slides online at: http://www2.openend.se/~iko/ep2012/\n",
