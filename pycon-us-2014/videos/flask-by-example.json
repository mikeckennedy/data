  "summary": "Flask is a web framework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good\nintentions. It is considered a micro-framework, but don't get the\n\"micro\" part fool you; Flask can do everything others can do, many times\nin a simpler, leaner way. In this tutorial session you will follow me as\nI write a complete web application in front of your eyes using the core\nframework and a handful of extensions.\n",
