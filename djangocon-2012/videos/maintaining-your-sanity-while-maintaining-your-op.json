  "description": "Introduction/Overview\n---------------------\n\nSo you want to release your Django app into the wild. Now what? I'll go\nover packaging your application to add to the Python Package Index\n(PyPi), creating documentation to host on Read The Docs and setup an\nenvironment to test your application against different versions of\nPython and Django. I'll also go over some things you should and\nshouldn't do when maintaining your app over the years.\n\nPackaging\n---------\n\n-  Creating a setup.py\n-  Registering your package\n-  Uploading your package\n-  Sane versioning with PEP386\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n-  Getting started with Sphinx\n-  Using Read the Docs\n\nTesting\n-------\n\n-  Running your app tests\n-  Testing multiple Python/Django versions with tox\n-  Testing your documentation build\n\nThings to Do\n------------\n\n-  State your goals\n-  Let others help you\n-  Include a license\n-  Prepare for the future\n\nThings to Avoid\n---------------\n\n-  Rejecting every contribution\n-  Accepting every contribution\n-  Developer burnout\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nReusable applications are my favorite feature of Django. It does take\nwork to maintain an open source app but it can be quite rewarding. If\nyou use these tools you can help provide your users with the best\nexperience and empower them to help you with your application.\n",
