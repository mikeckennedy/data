  "description": "As the feedback loop between developers and customers continues to\nshrink, the ability to deliver features and fixes in near real-time\nbecomes more crucial. Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines can enable\nteams to deliver code quickly but optimisation of the Build, Test and\nDeploy stages can be the difference between a 10 minute deployment and a\n5 hour deployment.\n\nAt Demonware we are using Docker to optimise the Test Stage of our CD\npipelines. Containerised testing has helped us reduce test execution\ntime, make tests more portable, better utilize our test infrastructure\nand deliver game services to our customers faster.\n\nThis talk will cover some of the challenges we faced along the way and\nthe various approaches we used to containerise our tests.\n",
