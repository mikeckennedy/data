  "description": "Jupyter widgets are powerful tools for building user interfaces with\ngraphical controls such as sliders and text boxes inside a Jupyter\nnotebook. Interactive widgets can also be rendered in Sphinx\ndocumentation, nbviewer, and static web pages. Jupyter widgets are more\nthan a collection of controls, they also are a framework that makes it\neasy to build custom GUI controls. Examples of custom widget packages\ninclude libraries for interactive 2-D charting (bqplot), 3-D graphics\n(pythreejs, ipyvolume), mapping (ipyleaflet), and more.Presenter(s):\nSpeaker: Matt Craig, Minnesota State University Moorhead Speaker: Jason\nGrout, Bloomberg LP Speaker: Sylvain Corlay, QuantStack Speaker: Maarten\nBreddels, Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen\n",
