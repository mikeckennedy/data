  "description": "The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a UK charity which creates low-cost, high-performance computers that people use to learn, solve problems and have fun. Through our educational programmes we work to put the power of digital making into the hands of people all over the world.\n\nWith Python on the Raspberry Pi, it's easy to start creating physical computing projects, and to experiment and tinker with add-ons and accessories from lights and buzzers to environmental sensors and robotics. This ease of access was accelerated with the creation of a new minimal boilerplate library called GPIO Zero, of which I am the primary author. In this talk I'll talk about the Foundation's work in education, share some great Pi projects, give a taster of how to get started in physical computing and dive into the technical innards of the GPIO Zero library. As well as a learning tool, the Pi is commonly used in home automation projects and industrial applications.\n",
