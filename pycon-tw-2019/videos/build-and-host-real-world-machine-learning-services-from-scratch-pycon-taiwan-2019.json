  "description": "Day 1, R2 13:00\u201313:45\n\nAs Python has become the most popular programming language for research, it is quite easy to clone the source code from state of the art machine learning projects, and then run the demos in your well-prepared local environments.\r\n\r\nHowever, is it easy to turn these demos into production-ready services? How can you make them sustainable? What actual challenges may you face?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will share a story about how we leverage the power of Python to build computer vision services for customers, and further improve these services through a self-designed machine learning pipeline.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/excusemejoe/build-and-host-realworld-machine-learning-services-from-scratch-pycontw2019\n\nSpeaker: \u66fe\u541b\u5b87\n\nJoe (\u5c31\u662f\u90a3\u500b\u6700\u8fd1\u4e00\u76f4\u6c92\u6709\u597d\u597d\u8fa6\u53f0\u5357\u62cd\u7684\u50a2\u4f19 QQ)",
