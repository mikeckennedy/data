  "description": "There is a multitude of options to translate database data in Django,\nfor example django-parler, django-modeltranslation, django-nece,\ndjango-hvad, and django-i18nfield (which is my own). The interesting\nthing is that these libraries are not multiple implementations of the\nsame thing, but they are all radically different in their design and\nthere are good reasons for every one of them. The sometimes subtle\ndifferences might not be obvious to a beginner in the Django world. This\ntalk will help them navigate through different solutions and make an\ninformed decision.\n",
