  "description": "This talk is aimed at those that have at least intermediate experience\nin Python and have played around with asynchronous Python using asyncio\nor other libraries. I want the audience to learn from my mistakes! For\ninstance, how easy it is to get into \u201ccallback hell\u201d (and how to\navoid/get out of it), how to screw up thread safety and deadlock\nyourself, and making code async but not actually concurrent.\n\nI\u2019ll talk through some anti-patterns and best practices that I learned\nthe hard way. This includes proper concurrency, calling coroutines from\nsynchronous code, working with threads and threadsafety, properly\nshutting down an async programs, and hidden \u201cgotchas\u201d.\n",
