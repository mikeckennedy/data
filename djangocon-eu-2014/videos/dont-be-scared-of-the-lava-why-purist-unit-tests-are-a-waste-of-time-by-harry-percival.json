  "description": "The \"purist\" approach to unit tests says that your tests should be\nperfectly isolated, that they should mock out any dependencies, and that\nthey should never, ever touch the database. The database is hot lava!\n\nIn this talk I will outline a (controversial) thesis: that such tests\nare just not very useful in the world of web application development,\nand Django. Given that my opinion is so wrong-headed (or maybe just\nplain wrong), I will endeavour to provide a balanced picture of the pros\nand cons of different testing approaches, including the arguments for\npurist unit tests, the options for integration testing and acceptance\ntesting, the \"functional core imperative shell\" pattern (AKA hexagon\narchitecture), all with a view to leaving the audience informed enough\nto make their own decisions about testing strategy.\n",
