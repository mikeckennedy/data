  "description": "**Audience level**\n\nExperienced\n\n**Description**\n\nUnfortunately, python is missing the goto keyword. This talk rights this\nhistorical wrong by presenting a module that allows the use of goto\nwithin a function. An overview of the implementation is provided, along\nwith rationale and performance results. Knowing what a decorator is will\nbe helpful for understanding the technical part of this talk.\n\n**Abstract**\n\ngoto in Python\n\n-  A brief history of the goto statement.\n-  Why have a goto in Python?\n-  Previous attempts at goto in Python\n-  Dynamically rewriting byte codes\n-  Problematic constructs\n-  Performance results\n-  Future work\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/carl-cerecke-goto-in-python-yes-really\n",
