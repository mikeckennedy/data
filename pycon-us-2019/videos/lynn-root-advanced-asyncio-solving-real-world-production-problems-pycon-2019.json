  "description": "Everyone\u2019s talking about it. Everyone\u2019s using it. But most likely,\nthey\u2019re doing it wrong, just like we did.\n\nBy building a simplified chaos monkey service, we will walk through how\nto create a good foundation for an asyncio-based service, including\ngraceful shutdowns, proper exception handling, and testing asynchronous\ncode. We\u2019ll get into the hairier topics as well, covering topics like\nworking with synchronous code, debugging and profiling, and working with\nthreaded code. We\u2019ll learn how to approach asynchronous and concurrent\nprogramming with Python\u2019s ``asyncio`` library, take away some best\npractices, and learn what pitfalls to avoid.\n",
