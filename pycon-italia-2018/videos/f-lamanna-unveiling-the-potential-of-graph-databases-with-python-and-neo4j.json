  "description": "Every time we are dealing with data coming from the real world, big and\nnot so big, you know that usually 80% of the time is needed to clean,\nprepare and arrange them. We can then spend the other 20% of the time\nenjoying our beloved data analysis.\n\nThe thing that you may know less is that in the last years, the Neo4j\ngraph database went into the light of being the \u201cright\u201d place to store\ndata, thanks to its capacity of direct modelling relations among data,\nits high availability and its easy, fast and clean query language\nCypher.\n\nIn this talk I\u2019m going to show you some tips to set up in the right way\nyour data using Pandas, in order to proper model and import them into\nNeo4j. A Neo4j Python driver is available to easily import Cypher\nqueries embedded in Python code. Still, the py2neo package allows\nbuilding and querying your database right within your favourite snake\ncommand line.\n\nForget about \u201ctall as teen\u201d SQL queries here; thanks to Pandas, Python\nand Cypher modelling, loading and query your database is going to be\nreally straightforward. After this talk, you\u2019ll can\u2019t wait to give Neo4j\na try!\n\nPrerequisite: a little knowledge of Pandas.\n\nin \\_\\_on **venerd\u00ec 20 aprile** at 11:45 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
