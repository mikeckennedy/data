  "description": "Writing a program in Python targeting the Android environment is well\nwithin your reach with the use of third party kits such as Kivy and the\nPygame Subset for Android.\n\nKivy is an \"Open source Python library for rapid development of\napplications\" and comes with tools which allow Kivy based programs to be\npackaged as Android apks for deployment to Android devices. In this\nsession I will give an overview of the Kivy development and deployment\nprocess. I will also draw inspiration from my successes and failures in\ndeveloping Python programs with Kivy to highlight Kivy's strengths,\nweaknesses and idiosyncracies. Code examples will be kept to a minimum,\nwith a focus on illustrating the capabilities of the Kivy library and\nexplaining how its parts work together.\n\nI will also reserve some time to discuss the Pygame Subset for Android\nand how it can be used to deploy Pygame based games to Android devices.\n",
