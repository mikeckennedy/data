  "description": "Pandas has accrued a sizable debt in flexibility and maintainability to deliver excellent performance. This talk will show how Pandas maintainers and Two Sigma are using Numba to pay off some of this debt in one of the gnarliest parts of the code: window operations. If merged to mainstream Pandas, this work will deduplicate code, make it easier to debug and make window operations extensible.",
