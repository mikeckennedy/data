  "description": "Te Tuhi Video Game System\n\nPresented by Douglas Bagnall\n\nAbstract\n\nTetuhi is a python program that turns drawings on paper into 2D top-down\nearly 80s style video games. This talk describes how.\n\nOutline\n\nTe Tuhi Video Game System is not a game in itself; rather it creates\ngames based on arbitrary images that it is given. To use it, you draw a\npicture of the game you want to play, and it will give you the game that\nyou really drew. The software was originally written for an art exhibit\nusing slightly specialised hardware, but it has been released under the\nGPL and runs on ordinary computers. It uses Pygame, PIL, and custom C\nextensions that allow it to evolve a playable game from a wide variety\nof pictures. This talk will discuss the techniques used (both refined\nalgorithms and hacky heuristics) and cover topics such as image\nanalysis, machine learning, and interface design. There will be a\ndemonstration.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n",
