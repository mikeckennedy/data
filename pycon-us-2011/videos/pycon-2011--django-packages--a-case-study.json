  "description": "Django Packages: A Case Study\n\nDaniel Greenfeld\n\nDjango Packages is the place to review Django apps, frameworks, and\nprojects. This talk is for everyone, including non-Django users, and\ncovers everything from architecture, API development, to interacting\nwith PyPI, Github, Bitbucket, etc. It will include tools, lessons\nlearned, and projects that fork the code to save the world and will\nfinish with an overview of the forthcoming pypackages.com.\n\nAbstract\n\nSince launch Django Packages has become the place to find and compare\napps, frameworks and projects produced by the Django Community. Through\nthe use of public APIs, Django Packages constantly fetches hard data\nfrom PyPI, Github, and Bitbucket, aproviding a powerful mash-up of\nreal-world data on the volume of usage of a particular package. At a\nglance you can see which package is the most downloaded, which is the\nmost used, and which has seen ongoing development.\n\nThe project is open sourced on Github, with all non-user data accessible\navailable via the API. Django Packages was conceived and and launched in\nthe 2010 Django Dash. Since launch it has seen features added\nincrementally and was a frequently mentioned project at the 2010\nDjangoCon and was #1 on Hacker News on Sunday, December 5, 2010. It's\npurpose is to provide a place for Django Developers to submit, research,\nand review apps, projects, and frameworks.\n\nThe talk will cover:\n\n-  Launching the project\n\n   -  The pre-Django Packages state of finding Django apps\n   -  Grids, not tags\n   -  Only hard metrics allowed, no opinions or rating systems!\n   -  Slurping content from PyPI, Github, Bitbucket, Launchpad,\n      SourceForge, and Google Project Hosting\n   -  Lessons Learned AKA The Zen of Python and PEP-8\n   -  Deployment and backups\n\n-  The Month after launch\n\n   -  New feature considerations\n   -  Handing over the keys to reduce bus factor\n   -  Excitement when seeing it being used as a reference\n\n-  DjangoCon\n\n   -  Sprint tactics for your pet project\n   -  Development of an API\n   -  Github, Google Project Hosting, and PyPI\n\n-  Going forward\n\n   -  Planned new features for Django Packages\n   -  Forking Django Packages to save the world\n   -  pypackages.com - a forthcoming place to review Python\n      applications, frameworks, and packages\n\n\n",
