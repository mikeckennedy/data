  "description": "It\u2019s a great time to be a software developer. Platforms are steadily\nbecoming more mature, useful tools are released almost daily and things\nthat seemed hopelessly futuristic only a few years ago are suddenly\ncommercially viable. Despite this, the software world is awash with\nbullshit. The success of the largest technology companies has led to a\nvery skewed set of lessons. This narrow focus is amplified by the\nventure capital industry and the fact that nobody really knows what\u2019s\ngoing to happen next.\n\nThe good news is, none of this actually matters. The basics of creating\nsomething useful and selling it for money remain the same. In this talk,\nI\u2019m not going to give you \u201cone weird trick\u201d or tell you to ~\\* just\nfollow your dreams \\*~. But I\u2019ll share some of the things we\u2019ve learned\nfrom building a successful software company around commercial developer\ntools and our open- source library spaCy.\n",
