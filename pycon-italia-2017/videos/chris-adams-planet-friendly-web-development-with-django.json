  "description": "You may have heard the quote \u201cSoftware is eating the world\u201d to describe\nhow services like Airbnb, Uber, Slack and Skype are replacing the likes\nof hotels, taxis and the office commute. As software engineers, part of\nour job is accelerating this shift.And it\u2019s easy to think that a shift\nfrom moving atoms, to moving bits, is a net win for the planet.However,\nmoving all those bits for our sites around takes servers. And these\nservers run on electricity. And most of this electricity powering our\nservers comes from burning fossil fuels. And burning these is a key\ndriver of climate change - the kind of disruption we don\u2019t want.So, what\ncan we do? We\u2019re not going to stop sharing cat pics anytime soon, but we\ncan change how we build online services to make them greener, load\nfaster, and convert better, by borrowing techniques from web performance\noptimisation and containerisation, as well as good old common sense.\nThis talk will show how we can start on the journey to more planet-\nfriendly, sustainable django web development.\n",
