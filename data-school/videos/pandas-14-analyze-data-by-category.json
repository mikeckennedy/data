  "description": "The pandas \"groupby\" method allows you to split a DataFrame into groups, apply a function to each group independently, and then combine the results back together. This is called the \"split-apply-combine\" pattern, and is a powerful tool for analyzing data across different categories. In this video, I'll explain when you should use a groupby and then demonstrate its flexibility using four different examples.\n\nThis is video 14 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
