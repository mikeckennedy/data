  "description": "Intranets have always been the ultimate challenge for an organisation, be it from a technical point of view, from the information design, productivity wise or socially. People who love their intranet are scarce. This has to change, the focus must be on people, content and ease of use. Ploneintranet is an effort by 12 Plone companies from Europe and the US, addressing the issue that an intranet solution must be more than just the sum of its add-ons. The talk aims to give an overview on the background of PloneIntranet, where it can be used, its philosophy and how to get involved.",
