  "description": "Async is all the rage, mostly because it simplifies waiting for an operation that takes some time to finish. Python went all in on asyncio by changing the language to support it (async/await) iIn this microservices era where many of the applications we develop consume several 3rd party API services, async is the fast track to success. In this talk, I\u2019ll demonstrate the benefits of going async for a web application, justify choosing Sanic over other web frameworks like aiohttp. I\u2019ll do so by transforming a Flask backed application to a Sanic backed application. Finally, I\u2019ll provide tips & tricks from my experience on measuring, monitoring and testing async code.",
