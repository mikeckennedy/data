  "description": "\"You Have Written A Web Application, Now What?\" by: Amit Saha\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the next steps after you have written a web application. Python frameworks and libraries makes it really easy to write a highly performant web application out of the box, but the problems that come next needs a number of building blocks and tools to come together.\n\nWe will talk about deploying your web application and discuss scaling up and down policies so that we can cater to peak traffic demands. We will discuss how we can peek into our application\u2019s performance by exporting \u201chealth\u201d status and metrics, and learn about implementing distributed tracing into our web application.\n\nAs far as possible, the talk will discuss generic strategies, only using specific tools/software for hands-on examples.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com",
