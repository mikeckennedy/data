  "summary": "Authors: Michael Droettboom\n\nTrack: Reproducible Science\n\nThis talk will be a general \"state of the project address\" for\nmatplotlib, the popular plotting library in the scientific Python stack.\nIt will provide an update about new features added to matplotlib over\nthe course of the last year, outline some ongoing planned work, and\ndescribe some challenges to move into the future. The new features\ninclude a web browser backend, \"sketch\" style, and numerous other\nbugfixes and improvements. Also discussed will be the challenges and\nlessons learned moving to Python 3. Our new \"MEP\" (matplotlib\nenhancement proposal) method will be introduced, and the ongoing MEPs\nwill be discussed, such as moving to properties, updating the\ndocstrings, etc. Some of the more pie-in-the-sky plans (such as styling\nand serializing) will be discussed. It is hoped that this overview will\nbe useful for those who use matplotlib, but don't necessarily follow its\nmailing list in detail, and also serve as a call to arms for assistance\nfor the project.\n",
