  "description": "In Codice Ratio is a research project to study tools and techniques for\nanalyzing the contents of digitized historical documents from the\nVatican Secret Archives (VSA). Being digitized as images, their text\ncontent is still unaccessible without expert human intervention:\ntranscription is therefore a key enabler for search and automation of\nknowledge discovery on such large collections. Handwritten documents are\nparticularly challenging, as traditional OCR does not apply, and state\nof the art handwritten text recognition systems require very large and\nexpensive to obtain datasets. ICR\u2019s transcription system is based on\nconvolutional neural networks and statistical language models, and\nrequires minimal dataset collection effort.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1797\n\nin \\_\\_on **Saturday 4 May** at 18:45 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
