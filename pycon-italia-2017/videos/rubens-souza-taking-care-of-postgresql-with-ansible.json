  "description": "**Ansible** is a powerful automation tool written in **Python**. With\nits modules already built for **PostgreSQL**, we can easily manage the\nmost advanced open source database, making sure the configuration is\nexact in every detail and repeatable as many times as it is needed. In\nthis talk we will understand how **Ansible** works, see some of its main\nmodules for system/cloud administration, and learn how it can be used to\norchestrate **PostgreSQL** deployments, managing all parts of the\nprocess at ease. A **PostgreSQL** test environment configuration, using\n**Ansible** and **Vagrant**, will be shown as an example.\n",
