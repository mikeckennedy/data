  "description": "You might have heard of Hypothesis - a testing library which has been generating test inputs and finding bugs for eleven years now, and used by about 5% of all Python users (Pytest is about 50%).  But have you seen the more advanced tricks?\n\n- *GASP* as `hypothesis write` generates the tests themselves!  (without a language model)\n- *THRILL* at our new observability tooling - you'll never wonder what happened again!\n- *BRACE YOURSELF* for a workflow with coverage-guided evolution, the black art of SMT solving, and a distributed database!\n\nCome one, come all, and enjoy a live demo that you won't soon forget!  With a little luck, you might even find something practical to take away for your own testing....\n",
