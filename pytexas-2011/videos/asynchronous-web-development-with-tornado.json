  "description": "Web frameworks like Django, Flask, etc. are great for most traditional\nweb sites. However, there is a growing need to produce web applications\nthat are responsive to external \"events\", whether a response from\nTwitter's API or a new message in an online chat room. Newer,\nnon-blocking frameworks like Tornado seek to address this in a scalable\nmanner.\n\nThis talk will briefly introduce non-blocking principles and patterns,\nand move quickly into an overview of the library, as well as use cases\nand anti- use cases. A portion of the time will also be spent pointing\nout community libraries that are building on Tornado's foundation.\n\nOutline:\n\n#. Introduction\n\n   #. Why another framework?\n   #. Intro to Asynchronous Design\n#. Overview of a Tornado project\n\n   #. Application\n   #. Basic (blocking) Request Handlers\n   #. Templates\n   #. Asynchronous Handlers\n   #. To block or not to block\n#. Batteries included\n\n   #. Auth module\n   #. Options module\n   #. Database\n   #. UIModules\n   #. Security\n\n#. Community\n\n   #. Tornad.io\n   #. No-SQL libraries\n   #. Twisted integration\n   #. Torn Admin\n\n#. Q&A\n\n",
