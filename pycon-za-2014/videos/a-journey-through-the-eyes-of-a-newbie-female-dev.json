  "description": "Graduating from a 90% male computer science class, to an initially 100%\nmale software development team, finally allowed me to realise that there\nis a dire lack of women in the computer science field. Entering this\nindustry in a minority invokes initial feelings of the need to\nconstantly prove oneself and one's capabilities \u2013 normally this puts one\nat an immediate disadvantage. However, given the correct circumstances,\nsurrounding environments and attitudes, these adverse feelings can\nquickly be replaced with self-confidence. I was fortunate enough in my\ndaily working environment to have my opinion given the weight that it\ndeserved. However, experience has also taught me that the sailing is not\nalways so smooth within every aspect of the development field. Certain\nenvironments are a lot less welcoming to women because of the strange\nmisconception that they are going against the norms of society. As a\nnewbie, within the development industry, one has to be able to adapt and\nhave an open mind to gain unbounded knowledge and learning experiences.\nThe world of development is a polyglot environment and striving to build\nan ambitious career involves lots of hard work and dedication. I would\nlike to take the audience on a journey to experience the obstacles,\ngrowth and challenges that I\u2019ve faced. I also aim to provide concrete\nsuggestions on increasing female willingness to join the tech industry,\nand improving co-existence in the development environment. As a\ndeveloper, my goal is to provide inspiration to capable young women, to\nfathers who have daughters, brothers who have sisters, and men who have\nfemale colleagues. To convey that I have embraced the development\nenvironment, and that we within the tech industry should never shy away\nfrom the opportunity to increase our pool of passionate developers. We\nare proudly South African and most definitely should be known for our\ndiversity\u2026.\n",
