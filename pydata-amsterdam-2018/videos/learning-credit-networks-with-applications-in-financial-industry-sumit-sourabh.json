  "description": "The purpose of this talk is to illustrate the importance of network-based models in financial industry since the 2007-08 crisis. I will present our novel method to learn a (Bayesian) network using default dependence of financial institutions and show how financial distress can propagate via such a network. I will share some examples where we extensively use NetworkX and bnlearn packages.",
