But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We can make this aspect of pandas easier to grasp by simplifying the copy/view rules, and at the same time make pandas more memory-efficient. And get rid of the SettingWithCopyWarning.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/XJMXFK\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
