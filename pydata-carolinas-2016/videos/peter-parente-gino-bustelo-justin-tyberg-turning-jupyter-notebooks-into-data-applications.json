  "description": "Together, we will use Jupyter notebooks and the new Jupyter dashboard\nand declarative widget extensions to create an interactive\napplication. By doing so, we hope to demonstrate the value of the\nJupyter ecosystem for rapidly building just-good-enough solutions.\n\nWe will start by finding and analyzing relevant data in a Jupyter\nnotebook. We will drag-and-drop our notebook cells into a grid layout,\nand publish it as a standalone web app. We will add interactivity to\nour notebook and redeploy our app as we iterate.",
