  "description": "| Part 1 \u2013 Digitizing documents with powerful python libraries\n| So.. in the digital era you suddenly realise that until very recently\n  not all valuable information kept is/was machine friendly, there are\n  tons of word and pdf documents with reports, meetings minutes,\n  contracts and so-on waiting to be re-discovered. With python libraries\n  PdfMiner, PyPDF2 among others, we will unlock the power of text data\n  in pdf format.\n\nPart 2 \u2013 Optimise risk assessment with advanced machine learning models\nTraditional risk assessment in insurance process can be based on\ncreating a set of rules to classify cases that are likely to default.\nWith powerful machine learning libraries such as SCIKIT-LEARN and\nXGBOOST, a probability of default model is trained using historical data\nto predict the future cases. In order to understand the decision making\nprocess, we can evaluate the output using Eli5 libraries and create\nvisualisation tools for the end users.\n",
