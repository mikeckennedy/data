  "description": "Continuous Delivery sounds easy in theory, but it\u2019s hard to do in\npractice. There are myriads of things you can and should do to get your\ncode delivered faster, reliably. We look at what we can do as Python\ndevelopers, or as a small or mid-sized team to make the industrialized\nsoftware development production chain come true.\n\n-  What is Continuous Delivery?\n-  Why should we do it?\n-  We explain a hands-on process and show tools and platforms that can\n   be used.\n\nWe may have time to try the demonstrated tools and setups in a hands-on\ndemo. Bring your own notebook and get an immediate feeling of CD.\n",
