This talk will analyze the nightmare, and provide the treatment for it. This is the right talk for you if you have encountered UnicodeEncodeError but not knew about the root cause yet. After the talk, you will know the difference between str and bytes in both python2 and python3 and learn the cleaner way to write string.\r\n\r\n* This talk will organize many previous PyCon talks with real world supporting python3 experiences.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/ssuser2cbb78/the-strbytes-nightmare-before-python2-eol\n\nSpeaker: Kir Chou\n\nA code monkey builds search services in Amazon jungle.
