    "description": "Day 2, 11:30-12:00\n\nAbstract\n\nThe talk will introduce TronGisPy using two use cases, Crop Farmland Classification and Forest Tree Types Classification. TronGisPy is an image preprocessing tool for machine learning and developed to master GIS imagery\u2019s peculiarities. Often, the enormous size of images and inconsistency of datatype or bands (e.g. float or 16-bit integer) are primary challenges; yet, data scarcity (e.g. one per week) remains as the major limitation. This highlights TronGisPy\u2019s capability to process the GIS images for general ML models. The popular functions used in both use cases will be introduced such as plotting, cliping, mapping, proojection, spliting and terrain analysis functions. For more functions in TronGisPy, please refer to: https://github.com/thinktron/TronGisPy.\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\nHackMD: https://hackmd.io/@pycontw/2021/%2F%40pycontw%2FS1JfO75GF\n\nSpeaker: \u738b\u9078\u4ef2\n\nInnovative and motivated AI engineer with strong integration and problem-solving skills. Focusing on computer vision & time-series machine learning research and implementation, especially in the GIS & remote sensing field, for 3 years. 2+ years\u2019 industry experience in helping enterprises import AI functions in their business flow.
