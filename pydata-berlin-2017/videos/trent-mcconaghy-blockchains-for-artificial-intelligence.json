  "description": "This talk describes the various ways in which emerging blockchain technologies can be helpful for machine learning / artificial intelligence work, from audit trails on data to decentralized model exchanges.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nIn recent years, big data has transformed AI, to an almost unreasonable level. Now, blockchain technology could transform AI too, in its own particular ways. Some applications of blockchains to AI are mundane yet useful, like audit trails on AI models. Some appear almost unreasonable, like AI that can own itself\u200a\u2014\u200aAI DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) leading to the first AI millionaires. All of them are opportunities. Blockchain technologies\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially planet-scale ones\u200a\u2014\u200acan help realize some long-standing dreams of AI and data folks. This talk will explore these applications.\n\n",
