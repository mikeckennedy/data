  "description": "Zimbabwe currently has a very high literacy rate of over 90%, despite a very high literacy rate of 90%. While other countries are looking for skilled workers, the opposite is true for Zimbabwe, which has millions of skilled workers looking for employment. Fortunately, the Internet has turned the world into a global village, yes, everyone is talking about globalization! In my talk, I intend to share on the avenues of freelancing and remote working as possible employment/business opportunity for the ordinary, unemployed person in Zimbabwe. I will share on the benefits of both to the developer as well as the nation. I will also share on how to get started as a freelancer or remote worker, with the aim of presenting new and possible employment/entrepreneurship avenues for fellow developers in Zimbabwe.",
