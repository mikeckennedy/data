  "description": "DataKind UK works with charities across the country to help them harness\nthe power of data science. We recently ran a year-long project with\nCitizens Advice. As you probably know, Citizens Advice offers\nconfidential, impartial advice and support on a number of day-to-day\nissues ranging from claiming benefits to faulty goods. DataKind UK\nhelped the organisation pull together and understand their disparate\ndata sets to get a better picture of the emerging social problems that\npeople in the UK face. Here is one small part of that project...\n\nOn average, 5,700 people walk into their local Citizens Advice Bureau\nevery single day. Of these people, at least 30% are repeat visitors.\nThey come in seeking advice with one problem, and return months later\nwith a different problem. If we could better understand the\nrelationships between these problems, could Citizens Advice offer\npreventive advice, and thereby reduce cost and provide a better service?\nThat's what we sought to find out. Using Python, Scipy, Networkx, Spyre\nand D3.js, Billy Wong, a DataKind UK volunteer worked to tackle this\nproblem. Come to our talk to see the result!\n",
