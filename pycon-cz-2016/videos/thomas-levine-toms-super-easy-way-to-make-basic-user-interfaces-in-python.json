  "description": "Horetu (https://pythonhosted.org/horetu) exposes Python functions as\ncommand-line interfaces, web interfaces, and configuration files. In\naddition to being a very practical tool, horetu is interesting\nbecause its implementation demonstrates the capabilities of function\nobjects. Finally, horetu can construct powerful interfaces and\ndetailed documentation from functions that were written with no\nintent of being used with horetu; it is, consequently, a clear\ndemonstration of the merits of following conventions.",
