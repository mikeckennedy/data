  "description": "Last year we decided to create official clients for the most popular\nlanguages, Python included.\n\nSome of the goals were:\n\n-  support the complete API of elasticsearch including all parameters\n-  provide a 1-to-1 mapping to the rest API to avoid having opinions and\n   provide a familiar interface to our users consistent across languages\n   and evironments\n-  degrade gracefully when the es cluster is changing (nodes dropping\n   out or being added)\n-  flexibility - allow users to customize and extend the clients easily\n   to suit their, potentially unique, environment\n\nIn this talk I would like to take you through the process of designing\nsaid client, the challenges we faced and the solutions we picked.\nAmongst other things I will touch on the difference between languages\n(and their respective communities), the architecture of the client\nitself, mapping out the API and making sure it stays up to date and\nintegrating with existing tools.\n",
