  "description": "In this talk, you'll learn how I built DIVSPL (Dustin Ingram's Very\nSpecial Programming Language), a tongue-in-cheek domain-specific\nlanguage, which is particularly good for implementing FizzBuzz -- as\nquickly as possible.\n\nWe'll build DIVSPL with RPLY, an implementation of David Beazley's PLY\n(but with a \"cooler\" API) and make it compatible with RPython, a\nrestricted subset of the Python programming language. Along the way,\nyou'll learn about lexers, parsers, and grammars, and in the end, you'll\nknow how to build your own language.\n",
