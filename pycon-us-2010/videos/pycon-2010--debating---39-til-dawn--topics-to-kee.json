  "description": "Debating 'til Dawn: Topics to keep you up all night\n\nMike C. Fletcher (VRPlumber Consulting Inc.)\n\nPyCon is about staying up all night hacking. When you're tired, you\ndon't sleep, you debate ideas with your sprint-mates! This presentation\nwill attempt to condense the best of the last few years of PyGTA into a\n30-minute jumping off point full of wild assertions, unreasonable\nassumptions, and just plain wrong-headed ideas to kick-start those\nheated discussions that just keep going long into the night. What are\nyour programming mantras? What million-dollar ideas do you have to\nimprove Python? Should there be programmer liability? Is there art in\nprogramming and should there be? Are you a cowboy coder or an\nstraight-laced engineer? Is PyCon really about staying up all night\ndiscussing ideas? We'll have a feedback channel to share your thoughts,\nwe'll keep it moving, and we'll see if we can't make this the most\nsleepless PyCon yet.\n",
