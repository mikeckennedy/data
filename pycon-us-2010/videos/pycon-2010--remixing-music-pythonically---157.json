Lindsay\n\nThe Echo Nest Remix API (`http://code.google.com/p/echo-nest-\nremix/ <http://code.google.com/p/echo-nest-remix/>`__) was made open\nsource by The Echo Nest, a \"music intelligence\" company based in the\nBoston area in the autumn of 2008. This talk will offer details on the\nconcise expressivity offered when editing multimedia driven by\ncontent-based features, and some insights on what Pythonic magic did and\ndidn't work in the development of the modules. Audio and video examples\nof the fun-yet-odd outputs that are possible will be shown.\n",
