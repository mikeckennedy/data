  "description": "Extracting meaning from data is one of the biggest challenge in science and industry. We can see many types of network-like data in Nature and man-made systems from social networks to protein-protein interaction networks. Here, I would like to show the capabilities of NetworkX which is a package for creation, manipulation and studying complex networks with Python. The topics involved this presentation will be:\n\ni) a very brief introduction to NetworkX (also mentioning other relevant python packages); and \nii) real examples and use cases in the second part (community detection and visualization with python), with a little hands-on session.\n\nSlides available here:\nhttp://il.pycon.org/2016/static/sessions/orsolya-vasarhelyi.pdf\n\nand here (requires flash):\nhttp://prezi.com/szsbgd2ortmu/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share",
