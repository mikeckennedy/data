  "description": "Deployment automation, cloud platforms, containerization, short\niterations to develop and release software\u2014we\u2019ve progressed a lot. And\nfinally it\u2019s official: Kubernetes and OpenShift are the established\nplatforms to help us do scaling and zero downtime deployments with just\na few hundred lines of YAML. It\u2019s a great time.\n\nCan we finally put all our eggs into one basket? Identify the cloud\nplatform that fits our needs, and jump on it? That could well backfire:\nVendor lock-in is the new waterfall, it slows you down. In future you\u2019ll\nwant to jump over to the next better platform, in a matter of minutes.\nNot months.\n\nThis talk is about The Art of Writing deployment pipelines that will\nsurvive Kubernetes, OpenShift and the like. It\u2019s for Python developers\nand Kubernetes enthusiasts of all levels \u2013 no domain specific knowledge\nrequired, all you need to understand will be explained. You\u2019ll learn how\nto separate application-specific and deployment-specific configuration\ndetails, to maximize your freedom and avoid vendor lock-in.\n\nCome see a demo of a Django project setup that covers everything from\nlocal development to automatic scaling, flexible enough to be deployed\non any of your favorite container platforms. Take home a working,\nfuture-proof setup for your Python applications.",
