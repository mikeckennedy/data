  "description": "Find yourself doing the same thing over and over again? Does it take\nmore than one command to run your tests? build your docs? publish your\nproject? deploy?\n\nIt is often difficult to share your code because others can run or test\nit? Does your README have a series of complicated steps to get things\nset up?\n\nThis talk explores three open-source tools that are wonderful at helping\nyou and your project automate tasks. We'll look at Tox, which\nspecializes in Python test environments, Nox, which offers a slightly\ndifferent approach, and finally, PyInvoke, which you can use to automate\njust about anything.\n",
