  "description": "Readability and Maintainability are Boring\n\nIn my time, I\u2019ve written some really exciting code: I\u2019ve overridden\nnearly every operator in python and I've written logic in XML. It was a\nlot of fun, but it was all impossible to maintain. In this session I\u2019ll\nwork through some beginner to intermediate techniques for making code\nmore predictable and manageable and share a few stories from projects\npast. I\u2019ll tell you why you shouldn\u2019t make a CSS class called \u201cyellow\u201d,\nwhat a variable called \u201cnoecho\u201d really ought to do, and why you probably\ndon\u2019t need a variable called \u201cnoecho\u201d anyway.",
