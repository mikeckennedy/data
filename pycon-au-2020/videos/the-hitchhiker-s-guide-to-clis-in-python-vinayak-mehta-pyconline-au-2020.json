  "description": "Vinayak Mehta\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/UFBPBV\n\nCommand-line applications and interfaces are used by both newcomers and experienced Python developers everyday. But do you know how they came to be? Hop on to this ship as we go through the CLI galaxy and look at its history, explore the CLI anatomy and discover some Python packages that can help us create them.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll then emulate one of the most popular CLIs of our time by writing our own CLI using Click, and see how we can package it and publish it on PyPI. Are you ready to travel faster-than-light using this ship\u2019s Infinite Improbability Drive? Carry your towel!\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 16:35:00 2020 at Python 2",
