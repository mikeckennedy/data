  "description": "Designing a good command line tool is challenging. Command line tools\nlook archaic compared to modern graphical interfaces, discoverability is\na big issue for command line tools, proactive help is hard to implement.\nThis talk will cover a set of specific techniques to help alleviate\nthose challenges.\n\nHow did `pgcli <http://pgcli.com>`__ and `mycli <http://mycli.net>`__\novercome these problems? We will cover specific examples where command\nline apps shine. The examples will be drawn from pgcli, mycli and\n`bpython <http://bpython-interpreter.org/>`__. This talk will suggest\nlibraries and show how they can help you implement a wonderful command\nline interface.\n\nThe libraries covered in this talk include\n`python-prompt-toolkit <https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit>`__,\n`pygments <http://pygments.org/>`__,\n`click <http://click.pocoo.org/>`__,\n`fuzzyfind <https://github.com/amjith/fuzzyfinder>`__.\n\nThe goal of the talk is to distil the ideas that exist in successful\ncommand line applications as guidelines for building powerful command\nline applications.\n",
