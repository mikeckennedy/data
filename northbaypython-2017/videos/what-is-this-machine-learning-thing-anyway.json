  "description": "This talk will introduce a machine learning technique called linear regression, in a way that's targeted at working developers, not mathematicians or theoretical computer scientists. Want to get started with machine learning? This is how. Many of the principles of linear regression apply to other machine learning techniques, so the ground we cover today will set you up to explore the wider world of machine learning.",
