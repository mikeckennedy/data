  "description": "We all know we should be writing tests, but coming up with tests for every edge case is hard work and you will inevitably miss some. Tell Hypothesis what kind of data your tests need and let it explore that space. When it finds a bug, it finds the simplest case where your code fails.\n\nIn this talk, I'll show you how to use Hypothesis in your projects to find more bugs than you would imagine.",
