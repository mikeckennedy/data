    "description": "Speaker:: Dani\u00ebl Willemsen Welmoet Verbaan\n\nTrack: PyData: Visualization\nHave you struggled getting your valuable machine learning model into the hands of users? No matter how good your ML model is; a lack of monitoring and insights can prevent users from using your product. For this reason, you should build a monitoring dashboard that serves two functions: a. Monitoring of performance metrics and b. Delivering insights to improve understanding of the model & it\u2019s predictions. In this talk, we explain how these two functions combined contribute towards the primary goal of getting a valuable model into the hands of users & show how easy it is to create such a dashboard through streamlit.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/METVVV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
