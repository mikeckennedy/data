  "description": "Magic methods are a very powerful feature of Python and can open a whole\nnew door for you. However, with great power comes great responsibility.\n\nIn this talk we explore magic method's capabilities by first designing\nnew interfaces in a series of fun experiments. Secondly, we play with\ncreating undeletable objects and learn about the mighty Garbage\nCollector in cPython and how a single magic method can overturn the fate\nof the object. Lastly, we create a lazy Redis client to illustrate a\npractical application of magic methods and learn about lazy loading.\n\nOnce you see what magic methods can bring to the table, the limit is\nonly your imagination!\n",
