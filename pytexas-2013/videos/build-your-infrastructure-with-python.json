  "description": "Cloud computing is changing the way that businesses think about their computing requirements. Instead of ordering hardware, waiting for delivery, allocating space in a data center, installing and wiring it up, and then configuring each piece of the system, you can now do the equivalent with a few clicks on a control panel, but that gets tedious. What's much more interesting is to do all of this programmatically, using our favorite language: Python!\n\nThis session will deep-dive into this topic by using pyrax, the Python SDK for the OpenStack and Rackspace Clouds. It will cover the as much of the following as time permits:\n\nGetting your cloud account and credentials\nInstalling pyrax\nCreating servers\nSaving a customized server as a template image\nCreating more servers on demand from your template images.\nCreating, attaching, and imaging Block Storage volumes\nUsing private networks to create a bastion host setup\nManaging these servers with a Load Balancer\nCreating and managing Cloud Databases\nUsing pyrax to manage your DNS\nObject storage and management using pyrax",
