  "description": "Recent work by Kiela et al. (2018) reveals that image and text\nmulti-modal classification models far outperform both text- and\nimage-only models. This talk will review work that extends Kiela et\nal.\u2019s (2018) research by determining if accuracy in classification may\nbe increased by the implementation of transfer learning in language\nprocessing. The performance of the model over a MM-IMDb (Arevalo et al.\n2017) dataset is analyzed and compared to the baseline provided by Kiela\net al. (2018).\n\nThe work is implemented with PyTorch and the goal of the talk will be to\nreview details of the implementation, and performance of the model as\ncompared to that recorded in Kiela et al. (2018). Attendees of this talk\nshould have a basic familiarity with neural nets developed in PyTorch\nfor the purposes of NLP and computer vision.\n\nReferences: Arevalo, J., Solorio, T., Montes-y-G\u00f3mez, M., & Gonz\u00e1lez, F.\nA. 2017.
