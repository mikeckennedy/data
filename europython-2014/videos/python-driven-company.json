  "description": "By introducing ipython notebook, pandas and the other data analysis\npackages that make python even more accessible and attractive, we\nattempted to adapt python as a core technology across our whole company.\nWe\u2019ve challenged the dominant position of Microsoft Excel and similar\ntools, and dared to replace it by pandas-powered ipython notebooks.\n\nDuring this transitional phase, we have been inspired and sometimes\nforced to develop multiple packages that extend pandas, numpy etc., in\norder to enable our colleagues, in other departments, to access all the\ndata they need. Moreover, we are developing several high level\nfunctionalities for the notebook environment.\n\nThe notebook environment is allowing us to be extremely responsive to\nthe changes our users are asking for, since, for part of the work, we\ndon\u2019t have to go through the whole traditional development process.\n\nThe talk focuses on challenges and problems we\u2019ve solved and managed in\norder to achieve our long term goal of creating highly agile,\ndata-driven non-tech teams, free from the constraints imposed by\nmainstream technologies, and all of this thanks to python.\n",
