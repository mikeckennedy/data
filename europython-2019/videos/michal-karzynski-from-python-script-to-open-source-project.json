  "description": "Did you write a cool and useful Python script? Would you like to share\nit with the community, but you're not sure how to go about that? If so,\nthen this talks is for you. We'll go over a list of simple steps which\ncan turn your script into a fully fledged open-source project.\n\nThe Python community has a rich set of tools which can help verify the\nquality of your code through automated code-review and linting. You can\nbenefit by taking advantage of this ecosystem. Complete the steps in\nthis checklist, and your project will be easier to maintain, you'll be\nready to take contributions from the community and those contributions\nwill be up to high standards. Your project will also keep up with other\nprojects on PyPI and you will be alerted if any new release causes an\nincompatibility with your code.\n\nThe same checklist can be used for non open-source projects as well.\n\nThe project maturity checklist includes:\n\n-  Properly structure your code\n-  Use a setup.py file\n-  Add entry\\_points for your script command\n-  Create a requirements.txt file\n-  Use Black to format your code\n-  Create a tox.ini config and include code linters\n-  Set up a Git repo\n-  Refactor your code to be unit-testable and add tests\n-  Add missing docstrings\n-  Add type annotations and a MyPy verification step\n-  Upload to GitHub\n-  Add a continuous integration service (e.g. Travis)\n-  Add a requirements updater (e.g. pyup.bot)\n-  Add test coverage checker (e.g. coveralls)\n-  Add a Readme file and documentation\n-  Publish your project on PyPI\n-  Advertise your project",
