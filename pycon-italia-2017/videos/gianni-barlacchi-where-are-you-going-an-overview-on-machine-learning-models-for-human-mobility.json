  "description": "The recent explosion of big mobility data, such as massive traces from\nGPS devices and mobile phone networks, opened the door to the study of\nthe quantitative spatio-temporal patterns characterizing human mobility.\nIn this talk we will first introduce the audience in the world of human\nmobility and related challenges. Then, we will briefly show how to deal\nin Python with geo- mobility dataset and finally, we will go trough the\nrecent advances in machine learning and deep learning in the context\nhuman mobility (e.g. prediction of the next visited place).\n",
