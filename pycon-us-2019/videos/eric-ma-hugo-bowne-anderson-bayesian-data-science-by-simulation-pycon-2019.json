  "description": "This tutorial is an Introduction to Bayesian data science through the\nlens of simulation or hacker statistics. We will become familiar with\nmany common probability distributions through i) matching them to\nreal-world stories & ii) simulating them. We will work with\njoint/conditional probabilities, Bayes Theorem, prior/posterior\ndistributions and likelihoods, while seeing their applications in\nreal-world data analyses. We\u2019ll see the utility of Bayesian inference in\nparameter estimation and comparing groups and we\u2019ll wrap up with a dive\ninto the wonderful world of probabilistic programming.\n",
