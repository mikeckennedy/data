  "description": "If you\u2019ve ever written some tests, or discovered that tested code can\nstill have bugs, this tutorial is for you. `Hypothesis`_ lets you write\ntests that should pass for every case\u2026 then finds bugs by generating\ninputs you wouldn\u2019t have looked for. Even better, you get to save time\nby writing fewer but more powerful tests, so this process improves your\nproductivity as well as your code!\n\n-  Learn what property-based testing is, and how it relates to `other\n   kinds of tests`_!\n-  Write your first property-based test, with example code and an\n   overview of common tactics!\n-  Describe inputs - use and compose strategies, then define your own or\n   infer them from other code!\n-  Use ``hypothesis.stateful`` to generate and test whole programs\n-  Get the low-down on Hypothesis: performance tips, debugging tools,\n   and more!\n\nYou\u2019ll be ready to find real bugs by half way through the tutorial; and\nby the end you\u2019ll be ready to use Hypothesis in ways we never imagined.\n\nThere will be dedicated time for Q&A about applying Hypothesis (or PBT\nideas) in your domain, testing anything from web apps to big data\npipelines to other languages, before you leave to drag the world kicking\nand screaming into a new and terrifying age of high quality software.\n\n.. _Hypothesis: https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/\n.. _other kinds of tests: https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/a-bunch-of-tests/\n",
