  "description": "Historically, Python coding on Windows has been kind of troublesome, but\nnot anymore. Since a couple of years ago it is possible write awesome\nquality Python code with Visual Studio. This is good news for Python\ndevelopers of all levels, because Visual Studio offers and incredible\nset of tools to enhance all the stages of product development: from\nmanaging virtual environments and handling package management, to\nwriting and refactoring code, up to testing & debugging - all of that\nfor free. In this talk I will demo how you can use PTVS to boost your\nPython development on Windows.\n",
