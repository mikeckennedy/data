  "description": "The Python logging module is a useful tool for getting all kinds of\ninformation out of your program; everything from error notifications\nthrough to debug information. The standard facilities are useful out of\nthe box, but, sometimes, you need a bit more. Not surprisingly, it turns\nout that the logging module is designed to be extended. This\npresentation shows some of the things you can do; things like gathering\nstatistics on message type, directing emails to different recipients\ndepending on severity, dynamic updating of attributes, and logging to a\ndatabase. The examples are based on the notification facilities in\nLokai. The talk covers: an overview of why I thought I needed the extra\nfeatures, a look at the logger structures that need to be changed, and\nsome actual code that does the job. I\u2019m sure there are many different\nways of doing this. Some of the code might be obvious in retrospect, and\nsome might be surprising. Whatever the case, if you havn\u2019t thought of\ndoing this before you might be encouraged to give it a go. And if you\nhave done it before you can always come and heckle.\n",
