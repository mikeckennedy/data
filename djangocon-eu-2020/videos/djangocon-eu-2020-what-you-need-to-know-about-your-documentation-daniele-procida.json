It\u2019s being used by companies for public and private documentation sets and in open-source software projects, and has helped improved the lives and work of numerous documentation creators and users. Whatever your documentation, and whatever state it\u2019s in, one hour after you walk into this session you will be in possession of a basic plan to improve it, and enough understanding to begin carrying out that plan. Your document will be better as a result.",
