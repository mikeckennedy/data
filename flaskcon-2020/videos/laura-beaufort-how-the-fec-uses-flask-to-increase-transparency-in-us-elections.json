  "description": "How the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) uses Flask and other open source technology to power its campaign finance data API. The FEC collects and publishes data on federal candidates: who is running, how much they have raised, where that money is coming from, and how it's spent. This presentation will cover how we use Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and Postgres to respond to nearly a million requests per day to query our four terabyte campaign finance database.",
