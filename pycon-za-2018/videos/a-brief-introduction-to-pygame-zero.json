  "description": "PyGame Zero is designed to be a boilerplate free wrapper around PyGame,\navoiding the need to manage the PyGame event loop and simplifying the\nAPI significantly.\n\nPyGame Zero is designed as an educational tool, but it does not\ncompromise on the ability to create complex games and so it also serves\nas a nice general purpose introduction to writing graphical games in\npython.\n\nIn this talk, I will give a brief introduction to PyGame Zero,\ndemonstrating it's core functionality and delve into some of the more\nadvanced features it provides.\n",
