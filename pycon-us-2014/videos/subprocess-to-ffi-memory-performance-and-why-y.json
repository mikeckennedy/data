  "summary": "Sometimes, the code you need just isn't available in Python, but\nsomeone's written some code in another language that solves your\nproblem. What options do you have for interacting with this external\ncode from within your program? We'll examine how to call external\nbinaries, what happens behind the scenes at a systems level, and how\nthese implementation details affect performance and memory usage. In the\nsecond part of the talk, we'll discuss the different options for more\ntightly integrating external code in the form of a C library for better\nperformance and control.\n",
