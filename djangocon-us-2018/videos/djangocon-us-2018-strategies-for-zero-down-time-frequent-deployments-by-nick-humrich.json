  "description": "Deployments can be stressful, but should\u2019nt be. We all hear about big\ncompanies deploying several, if not thousands of times a day. In order\nto acheive this, you have to be able to deploy without impacting\nperformance at all; you need to feel confident and comfortable when you\ndeploy. Even a couple miliseconds of downtime is unacceptable in these\nenvironments. Whether you have to provide SLA\u2019s to your customers or\nnot, being able to deploy without any downtime, allows you to deploy\nmore often, which leads to faster turnaround time on both bug fixes and\nfeatures. Successfully deploying without and downtime, however, is\nnon-trivial. Perhaps you have heard the term Blue/Green deployment, and\nwonder what that is. Come learn about some of the strategies used for\ndeployments, as well as all the changes to your code and your process\nyou will have to make in order for it to truly work, and make you feel\nmore confident on every deploy to production.\n",
