  "description": "Nowadays \u2018build and run\u2019 a predictive model is a quite easy task, thanks\nto frameworks that simplify things and set good defaults for you (i.e.\nKeras).\n\nBut how do you *effectively* train a model, in order to gain better\nperformance or to get your results faster? Do you feel frustrated every\ntime you need to set and then tune the network\u2019s hyperparameters, too?\nDon\u2019t worry!\n\nIn this talk I will share some practical tips&tricks (such as Model\nEnsembling and learning rate schedulers) and relative examples, derived\nfrom my personal experience or from literature, with the aim to improve\nneural networks capabilities and to get the convergence faster.\n\nThis talk is aimed at data scientists or everyone passionate about this\ntopic who wants to learn more.\n\nGently inspired by Practical Deep Learning for Coders Part 1 v2 of\n`fast.ai <http://fast.ai>`__.\n\nin \\_\\_on **sabato 21 aprile** at 12:45 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
