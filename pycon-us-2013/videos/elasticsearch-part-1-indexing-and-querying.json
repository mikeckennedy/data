  "summary": "Elasticsearch provides an easy path to clusterable full-text search,\nwith synonyms, faceting, and geographic math, but there's a paucity of\nwritten wisdom beyond its API docs. This talk, part 1 of a 2-part\nseries, surveys its capabilities and shows how its internal data\nstructures and algorithms work. With the groundwork laid, we explore how\nto choose efficient indexing and the right queries to make your apps go\nfast.\n",
