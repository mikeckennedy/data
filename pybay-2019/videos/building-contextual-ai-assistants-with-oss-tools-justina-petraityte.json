See pybay.com for more details about PyBay and click SHOW MORE for more information about this talk.\n\nDescription\nAI assistants are getting a great deal of attention from the industry as well as the research. However, the majority of assistants built to this day are still developed using a state machine and a set of rules. That doesn\u2019t scale in production. In this talk, you will learn how to build AI assistants that go beyond FAQ interactions using machine learning and open source tools.\n\nAbstract\nWhen built well, AI assistants provide great strategic business value and are fun to interact with. However, the majority of assistants built to this day are developed using just a set of rules and don\u2019t go beyond simple FAQ interactions. This doesn\u2019t scale in production and provides a rather disappointing user experience.\n\nIn this interactive talk, we will challenge the usual approach of chatbot development by introducing machine learning-based methods for dialogue management. You will learn the fundamentals of conversational AI, as well as machine learning techniques behind natural language and dialogue management. Finally, you will learn the basics of using Rasa Stack \u2013 an open source ML-based framework which empowers developers to build contextual assistants in-house.\n\nOriginal slides: https://t.ly/j93LV\n\nAbout the speaker\nJustina has a background in Econometrics and Data Analytics. Her curiosity for Data Science and human behaviour analytics has taken her to many places and industries \u2013 over the past three years she has been doing Data Science work across video gaming, fintech, insurance industries. Her interest in chatbots, natural language processing and open source has led her to Rasa, a Berlin-based conversational AI startup where she works as a Head of Developer Relations focusing on improving developer experience in using open source software for conversational AI.\n\nSponsor Acknowledgement\nThis and other PyBay2019 videos are via the help of our media partner AlphaVoice (https://www.alphavoice.io/)!\n\n#pybay #pybay2019 #python #python3 #gdb",
