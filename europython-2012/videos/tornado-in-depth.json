  "description": "Tornado is a non-blocking light-weight web server and framework. There\u2019s\nbeen many introductory talks about it, and it\u2019s time to look deeper into\nit: not just what Tornado does, but how it does it and what can we learn\nfrom it when designing our own concurrent systems. We\u2019ll cover each\ntopic in two parts: first we\u2019ll see how to use a certain feature in our\napplications; then, we\u2019ll dig into Tornado\u2019s source code to see how it\nreally works. How much time we\u2019ll spend in the \u201chow to use\u201d will depend\non the audience\u2019s knowledge of Tornado. Getting Started: quickly get a\nsimple Tornado application up and running. We\u2019ll keep digging into,\nchanging and poking this Application for most of the talk. An\nApplication Listens: what an Application is, how does Tornado start it\nand how does it process its requests. Application and IOLoop: we\u2019ll look\nat how the IOLoop receives the connections from the users and passes\nthem on to the Applications. Scheduled Tasks: we\u2019ll see how to schedule\ntasks and how the IOLoop will run them. Generators: we\u2019ll learn to use\ngenerators to handle the responses of our asynchronous calls, and how\nthey work with the IOLoop. Websockets: how to use them and how they\nwork. IOStream: how do Tornado\u2019s non- blocking sockets work. Database:\nhow to use non-blocking sockets to connect to a MySQL or MongoDB\ndatabase.\n",
