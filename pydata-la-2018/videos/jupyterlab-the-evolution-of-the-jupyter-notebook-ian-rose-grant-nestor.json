  "abstract": "In this talk, Grant Nestor and Ian Rose will introduce you to\nJupyterLab, the next-generation UI developed by the Project Jupyter\nteam, and its emerging ecosystem of extensions. JupyterLab differs from\nJupyter Notebook in that it provides a set of core building blocks for\ninteractive computing (e.g. notebook, terminal, file browser, console)\nand well-designed interfaces for them that allow users to combine them\nin novel ways.\n\nThe new interface enables users to do new things in their interactive\ncomputing environment, like tiled layouts for their activities, dragging\ncells between notebooks, and executing markdown code blocks in a\nconsole. The official APIs enable extension authors to extend the\ninterface in many ways. These include the rendering of custom\nvisualizations for new data types, new user-interface components, and\nthe addition of alternative storage backends like Google Drive or\nGitHub. We will pack in as many demos as time allows and open up for\nquestions at the end.\n",
