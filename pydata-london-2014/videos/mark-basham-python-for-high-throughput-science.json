  "description": "Diamond Light Source is the UK Synchrotron, a national facility\ncontaining over 20 experimental stations or beamlines, many of which are\ncapable of generating Terra-bytes of raw data every day. In this data\nrich environment, many scientists that come to the facility can be\ndaunted by the sheer quantity and complexity of the data on offer. The\nscientific software group is charged with assisting with this deluge of\ndata and as a small team it is imperative that provides sustainable and\nrapid solutions to problems. Python has proved to be well suited to this\nand is now used heavily at the facility, from cutting edge research\nprojects, through general pipe-lining and data management, to simple\ndata manipulation scripts. And by a range of staff and facility users,\nfrom experienced software engineers and scientists, to support staff and\nPhD students simply wanting something to help make sense of the data or\nexperimental set-up.\n\nThis presentation focuses on the current state of the scientific\nmanagement and data analysis within Diamond, and details the workhorses\nwhich are relied on, as well as what the future holds.\n",
