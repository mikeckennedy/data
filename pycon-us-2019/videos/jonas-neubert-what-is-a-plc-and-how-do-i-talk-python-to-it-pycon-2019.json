  "description": "Walk into any factory and you will see a Programmable Logic Controller\n(PLC). It's the small box that has a memory card and an Ethernet cable\non one side, and lots of colorful wires connected to the other end.\nInside runs the logic that turns inputs from sensors into outputs to\nrobots, conveyor belts and other machinery. PLCs evolved from relay\nbanks in the 1970s and have ruled the world of industrial automation\nsince then.\n\nIn the first half of this talk we will take a look at how they work, how\nto program them, and why a strange language called \"ladder logic\" is\n(still) the lingua franca for programming them. In a short on-stage demo\nI will write some PLC code to control a device on stage.\n\nIt's 2019 now and just running a PLC isn't quite enough anymore.\nEveryone is talking about the \"Industrial Internet of Things\" and they\nhave connected their PLCs to the company network. The second half of the\ntalk will look at how we can connect to PLCs to read data and influence\nthe running program with Python.\n",
