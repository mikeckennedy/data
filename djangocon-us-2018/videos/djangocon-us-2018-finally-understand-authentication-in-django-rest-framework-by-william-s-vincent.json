  "description": "Traditional Django handles user authentication for us. REST Framework?\nNot so much. The abundance of choice is overwhelming and typically THE\nbiggest obstacle for newcomers.\n\nThis talk is a deep dive on authentication in Django REST Framework.\nWe\u2019ll start with an overview of HTTP and REST APIs before demonstrating\nhow to implement the 4 built-in auth modes and their respective\npros/cons. Special attention will be paid to common gotchas such as, Why\ndo I need \u201cboth\u201d TokenAuth and SessionAuth? What are JWTs?\n\nNext we\u2019ll implement a real-world REST auth setup that includes user\nregistration, password reset/confirm, social auth, and endpoints for\nsign up, log in, and log out. The third-party packages\n``django-rest-auth`` and ``django- allauth`` will be used .\n\nBy the end of the talk attendees will understand the basics of REST\nauthentication, the tradeoffs involved, and walk away with a working\nimplementation to jumpstart their future projects.\n",
