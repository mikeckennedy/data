  "description": "Scattertext is a Python package that lets you compare and contrast how words are used differently in two types of documents, producing interactive, Javascript-based visualizations that can easily be embedded into Jupyter Notebooks. Using spaCy and Empath, Scattertext can also show how emotional states and words relating to a particular topic differ.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nNotebooks and presentation for this talk are available from https://github.com/JasonKessler/Scattertext-PyData.\n\nMotivation and introduction\n\n- What's the matter with word clouds?\n- How to read a plot made by Scattertext\n\nHow to make your own plots\n\n- Preparing a Pandas data frame with your data set\n- Plotting with Scattertext, and fine tuning plots for interpretability and speed\n\nScattertext and the Python NLP ecosystem\n\n- Visualizing emotions using Empath.\n- Using word vectors from spaCy and elsewhere see how topic-specific language differs.\n- Visualizing topic models from scikit-learn.\n\nLinks\n\n- Source code for the package is hosted on Github at https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext\n- For more information, please see the paper which will appear as a 2017 ACL Demo at https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00565",
