  "description": "Cisco, Juniper, Arista... plenty of network equipment vendors support some form of automated access tho their devices these days. Many of those access libraries are written in Python and made it the goto language for network engineers. From abstracting Netconf or SSH, configuring devices or retrieving structured data - depending on the vendor support, the available libraries provide plenty of functionality to take traditional network engineering to the next level.\n\nWe will walk you though what functionality a typical network library provides and will present examples on how to manage and configure your network infrastructure in an automated fashion.",
