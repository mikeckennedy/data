  "description": "Day 1, R3 15:55\u201316:10\n\nThis lecture will give a practical report on programming education using Python for elementary school \nstudents. Programming education for elementary school students often uses block-based programming \nlanguages such as Scratch. In contrast, I chose to teach with Python in order to provide the students \nwith insights into computer and hardware mechanisms. In this report, I share an educational method \nfor teaching programming, using Python, to elementary school students. In addition, I report the \ndifficulties associated with teaching Python to elementary school students.\n\nSlides: https://waseda.box.com/s/pvo3pmfuexymcs2v651epgoqlji2ptxq\n\nSpeaker: Daisuke Saito\n\nDaisuke Saito is a assistant professor of the School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University in Japan. He acquired a Doctor of Engineering degree from Waseda University in Japan. His research interests include programming education and digital game-based learning.",
