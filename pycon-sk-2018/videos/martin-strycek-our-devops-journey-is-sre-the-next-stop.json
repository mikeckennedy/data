  "description": "Over past few years we see significant raise in technology requirements,\ncomplexity of managing and delivering high reliability systems. Based on\nour first-hand experience we see that there does not exist one silver\nbullet way of doing DevOps and way how you manage Continuous Delivery\nfeatures. At Kiwi.com the transformation went from small applications to\ncomplex micro services architectures. This change did also impact the\ninfrastructure not only by numbers of servers, also on complexity of the\nsystem and ended with hybrid model of cloud and bare metal solution. In\nthis talk I will cover how our team of DevOps and Engineers battles with\ntasks such as deployment to many enviroments, infrastructure changes,\nmonitoring and also creation of processes and runbooks. We believe that\nthis talk can inspire you to adapt changes within your teams and never\nstop improving how you manage your infrastructure.\n",
