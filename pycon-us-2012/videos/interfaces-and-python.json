  "summary": "In 2.6, Python introduced the Abstract Base Classes. Before that we had\n\"protocols\" (and we still do). In this talk we'll look at how the\ngeneral concept of interfaces fits into today's Python. We'll also look\nat some of the alternate proposals of the past, some of the\ncontroversies around ABCs, and the direction interfaces might go in the\nfuture.\n",
