  "summary": "Programmers are, by the nature of their work, logicians. However, logic\ncan be more challenging than we sometimes think, and it's easy for us to\nmake logical mistakes, especially when they're to justify a proposition\nwe already believe. This is, at its core, what makes us not very good at\ntesting our own stuff, and what makes architecting a technical system so\nchallenging.\n",
