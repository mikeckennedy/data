  "description": "A tutorial for intermediate Python developers with none or little\nknowledge about Machine Learning.\n\nAfter presenting an existing dataset and giving a bit of context about\nthe problem, I will show step by step how to analyse it, train a\nsupervised classification model, optimise it and make predictions.\n\nDuring the tutorial we will make use of the following libraries and\ntools: pandas, jupyter, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy.\n\nEven if it won\u2019t be possible to follow each singular attendee, it\u2019s\nstrongly suggested to have a laptop ready with Python 3 installed and a\nvirtual environment properly configured and ready to be used. In this\nway attendees will have the possibility to try the shown code and\nexamples.\n\nin \\_\\_on **domenica 22 aprile** at 11:15 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
