  "description": "Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has been described as a \"quiet\nrevolution in AI\" that is poised to dramatically change the data science\nlandscape by using AI to automate many of the time-consuming aspects of\napplying Machine Learning to real-world problems. Academic researchers,\nstartups, and tech giants alike have begun developing AutoML methods and\ntools ranging from simple open source prototypes to industry-scale\nsoftware products. Yet beyond all the hype and vague tech jargon, many\nare left wondering: What is AutoML, really? In this talk, I will draw\nfrom my AutoML research experience to discuss the benefits of AutoML and\nhighlight some promising future directions of the field, including\nPython packages and other existing tools that offer AutoML\nsolutions.Presenter(s): Speaker: Randal Olson, Lead Data Scientist, Life\nEpigenetics, Inc.\n",
