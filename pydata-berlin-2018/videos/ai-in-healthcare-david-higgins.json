  "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big Data are buzzwords\nwhich have been receiving increasing attention in the past three years.\nThe healthcare space appears ripe for digitalisation, but so far most\nattempts to bring data methods to this space have been disappointing. I\nwill discuss the deeper reasons behind this situation.\n\nI distinguish between pure machine learing approaches and mathematical\nmodelling, to explain the relative strengths and weaknesses of each\napproach. Machine learning, in particular, has some important deficits\nwhen it comes to handling biological systems. But neither approach is\nperfect. I will finish by introducing a new type of model, a hybrid of\nboth approaches, which holds out the promise of allowing effective\napplication of data-driven methods whilst fitting-in with the\nlimitations of the healthcare domain.\n",

  "description": "I will discuss machine learning as it is applied to healthcare. The\nparticular focus of my talk is on the limitations of pure machine\nlearning approaches when it comes to biological systems. I will compare\nthis with pure mathematical model-based approaches, which on the one\nhand appear more suitable but ultimately have their own attendant set of\nproblems. I will finish up with hybrid approaches.\n",
