  "description": "Zimbabwean companies and individuals have been consumers of open source\nsoftware for over a decade now. Nevertheless, developers in Zimbabwe\nhave done little in terms of developing an active and vibrant open\nsource community until 2015 which saw the establishment of PyZim. This\nis because affiliation to professional bodies is not heavily emphasized\nin most industries, especially the ICT industry. The economic challenges\nfacing the country for the past two decades have also made affiliation\nto such organisations a luxury as the country has over 90% unemployment\nrate.\n\nGiven this background, it is no surprise that setting up a vibrant\nPython user group has been fraught with many challenges. In my talk, I\nintent to share the journey we have traveled in setting up PyZim. I will\nalso share our experiences organising Django Girls workshops and PyCon\nZimbabwe 2016. I will also share with the audience the challenges faced,\nopportunities arising, benefits accrued and important lessons learnt\nthrough the experiences.\n",
