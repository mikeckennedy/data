  "description": "In this session, you shall be introduced to a new framework for\nscientific computing, mainly\naimed at deep learning workloads. The framework consists of an ndarray\nlibrary that natively\nsupports GPU execution, an automatic differentiation engine that is\nflexible and fast, and\nan optimization package for gradient based optimization methods. We\nshall discuss practical\nworkflows, our features on top of python multiprocessing for efficient\nparallel data loaders\nand finally we shall briefly look at our upcoming just-in-time Tensor\ncompiler to fuse\ncomputations and execute them more efficiently.\n\nBiographical sketch\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nSoumith Chintala is a Researcher at Facebook AI Research, where he\nworks on deep learning,\nreinforcement learning, generative image models, agents for video\ngames and large-scale\nhigh-performance deep learning. Prior to joining Facebook in August\n2014, he worked at\nMuseAmi, where he built deep learning models for music and vision\ntargeted at mobile\ndevices. He holds a Masters in CS from NYU, and spent time in Yann\nLeCun's NYU lab building\ndeep learning models for pedestrian detection, natural image OCR,\ndepth-images among others.\n\n(Reproduced from https://research.fb.com/people/chintala-soumith/)\n",
