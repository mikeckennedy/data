  "description": "Geospatial data is data containing a spatial component \u2013 describing\nobjects with a reference to the planet's surface. This data usually\nconsists of a spatial component, of various attributes, and sometimes of\na time reference (where, what, and when). Efficient processing and\nvisualization of small to large-scale spatial data is a challenging\ntask.\n\nThis talk describes how to process and visualize geospatial vector and\nraster data using Python and the Jupyter Notebook.\n\nTo process the data a high performance computer with 4 GPUS (NVidia\nTesla V100), 192 GB RAM, 44 CPU Cores is used to run JupyterHub.\n\nThere are numerous modules available which help using geospatial data in\nusing low- and high-level interfaces, which are shown in this\npresentation. In addition, it is shown how to use deep learning for\nraster analysis using the high performance GPUs and several deep\nlearning frameworks.",
