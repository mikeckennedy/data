  "description": "Modern webapps react not just to user actions, but also to server events. Such bi-directional communication can be easily achieved using Web Sockets, a protocol standardized by W3C to be a default tool for full-duplex connections on the Web.\n\nAlthough most of web-frameworks do not support Web Sockets out of the box, Python has multiple options available making it a piece of cake. In combination with native async tools introduced since Python 3.4, the code can be very easy and elegant, leaving no excuses for long polling and other hacks. This talk showcases integrating Web Sockets in Python web-apps, focusing on situations that can make good use of it and presenting implementations with most popular frameworks.\n",
