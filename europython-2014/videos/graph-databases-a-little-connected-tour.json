  "description": "There are many kinds of NoSQL databases like, document databases,\nkey-value, column databases and graph databases. In some scenarios is\nmore convenient to store our data as a graph, because we want to extract\nand study information relative to these connections. In this scenario,\ngraph databases are the ideal, they are designed and implemented to deal\nwith connected information in a efficient way. In this talk I'll explain\nwhy NoSQL is necessary in some contexts as an alternative to traditional\nrelational databases. How graph databases allow developers model their\ndomains in a natural way without translating these domain models to an\nrelational model with some artificial data like foreign keys and why is\nmore efficient a graph database than a relational one or even a document\ndatabase in a high connected environment. Then I'll explain specific\ncharacteristics of Neo4J as well as how to use Cypher the neo4j query\nlanguage through python.\n",
