  "description": "Software development is a team game.\n\nWhen we want to deliver more work, one of the variables that we can\nchange is the team size. But as we all know, increasing the team size\ndoes not automatically translate into increased productivity & more\nfeatures shipped.\n\nIf things are left unmanaged, people can step on each other toes, block\neach other & generally decrease the overall productivity of a given\nsoftware project.\n\nIn this talk we'll identify different problems teams can face & see how\nwe can solve them using different strategies & patterns.\n\nIn the end, we want to enable the team to perform better & ship features\nwith high confidence. We want enable the team & put its potential into\nbuilding good software.\n\nProblems we are going to cover:\n\n-  Constant merge conflicts / working in the same files\n-  Blocking each other on different features / Feature deadlock\n-  Constantly switching between bugfixing & feature development\n-  Constant regressions and things breaking down\n-  Fighting with local setup & not being able to properly test things,\n   especially when working with 3rd parties\n-  Merge strategies & improving the work with git & GitHub\n-  Communication between team members & ego fights\n\nFor each problem, we are going to propose different solutions with\nprovided real-life examples from our experience & projects.\n\nThe examples show are going to be in the context of large Python /\nDjango projects.\n\nThis talk is the natural sequel of the following talks from previous\nEuroPythons:\n\n-  EuroPython 2017 - Practical Debugging - Tips, Tricks and Ways to\n   think - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ys4gCUtTh8\n-  EuroPython 2018 - Django structure for scale and longevity -\n   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG3ZdxBb1oo",
