  "summary": "Normally when you want to hack on a sweet hardware project, you bust out\nyour Arduino and start coding in what may as well be C. We as Python\ndevelopers know that sucks! Introducing BreakfastSerial, a framework\nthat makes it super simple to interact with Arduinos using just Python.\nIn this session, you'll learn the basics, see some fun demos, and become\na hardware-hacking pro in no time flat.\n",
