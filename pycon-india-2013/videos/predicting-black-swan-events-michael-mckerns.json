  "description": "We have developed a new rigorous mathematical framework for quantifying\nrisk designed to utilize all available information and predict the\nimpact of Black Swan events. These rigorous predictors are global\noptimizations over all possible valid scenarios, and do not rely on\ncommon approximations in computing priors that lead to the exclusion of\nhigh-impact rare events. Such optimizations, however, are\nhigh-dimensional, highly-constrained, and non- convex, and generally\nimpossible to solve with current optimization technology. I will present\nan overview of our mathematical framework, and the powerful optimization\nsoftware we have developed to rigorously solve real- world problems in\npredictive science, finance, and technology. The software runs in\nstandard python on a simple laptop -- however, it trivially scales up to\npotentially petascale and larger calculations running on some of the\nlargest computers on the planet.",
