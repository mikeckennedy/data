  "description": "Python is often used as a scripting language within graphics software. One of these is the open source 3D animation program Blender, which has a powerful python API that can be extended with any python library. At Invertex, we use this tool to automatically analyze 3D scans and generate custom products, in some cases ready for 3D printing. This talk will provide a short overview of Blender and its python API, and demonstrate how to use it with a few short examples.\n\nSlides available here: http://il.pycon.org/2016/static/sessions/tamir-lousky.pdf",
