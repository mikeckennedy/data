  "description": "In a distributed sensor network system with a Java based Cloud\napplication, mobile apps and a proprietary radio protocol accompanying\nit we developed an IoT appliance that connects the existing radio\ninfrastructure to the Cloud service developed in-house.\n\nUsing CPython 3.5 + Debian GNU/Linux 9 on an ARMv7 platform, we\ndeveloped the following features:\n\nOver the course of this project, we learned a lot about Test Driven\nDevelopment of Python apps in teams and DevOps in the IoT space. We\nwould now like to share our experience developing a Python application\nfor a headless IoT device and the things we would liked to have known\nupfront.\n\nThe talk is held both by Matthias Schmidt (Senior Architect at diva-e)\nand Thomas Keppler (Software Developer at diva-e).\n",
