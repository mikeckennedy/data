  "description": "Logs are your best friend, especially on one of those late nights when you try to troubleshoot a problem in production that was written by a co-worker who is on holiday. Logs are the main way to know what is happening with an application at runtime, but we don\u2019t realise how important they are until we actually need them. Unfortunately, they are usually an under-estimated part of the development process.\n\nThis talk will provide an overview of the logging module of the standard Python library and demonstrates some basic best practices and techniques to make the most out of our logging when we need it.\n\nAfter the talk, you'll be fully familiar with how to use the logging library, how it is actually designed, how it works, and how to go beyond its basic usage, as well as some sample recipes and configurations for complex applications.",
