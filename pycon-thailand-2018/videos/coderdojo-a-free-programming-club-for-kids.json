CoderDojo takes these principles and combines them into a self-directed learning environment. This talk covers the overall structure and concepts of CoderDojo, why you should set one up, lessons learned after operating CoderDojo for a year and why community-driven education is the future.\n\n\n\n--------\n\nMishari has been using Linux since 1994, coordinator with the distributed computing effort to break RC5-56 in 1997, built Thailand's largest Renderfarm for the animation Khan Kluay where he also started using Python.\nCurrently his obsessions are:\n* Delivering Systems as a Service at Proteus Ops\n* Homeschooling his kids (and fixing education)\n* Organizing Bangkok Scientifique, a monthly meetup for people interested in science and technology\n* Co-Founder of CoderDojo Thailand\n* Co-Founder of SciDojo Thailand, a support network for parents who want to build a science culture in their household\n* OpenstreetMap contributor\n* Cycling",
