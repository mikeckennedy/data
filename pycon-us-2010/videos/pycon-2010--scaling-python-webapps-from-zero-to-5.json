  "description": "Scaling Python webapps from zero to 50 million users - A top-down\napproach\n\nPresented by Jinal Jhaveri\n\nLOLapps is one of the top providers of social games and user generated\napplications with 50+ million monthly uniques on Facebook, MySpace and\nBebo. This session will focus on the top-down approach we took to scale\nour webapps for millions of users. Here are the 6 topics we will cover:\n\n-  Why is performance a big issue for Social Media\n-  How we profiled our apps and found bottlenecks using custom developed\n   and existing middleware\n-  The web application best practices we applied and results obtained\n-  How we traced database connection leaks\n-  Our caching strategies and the changes we made to speed up the\n   memcache client\n-  Results of our experiment using Paster and Tornado as our web\n   servers.\n\n",
