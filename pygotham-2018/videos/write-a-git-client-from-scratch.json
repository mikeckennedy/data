  "description": "`git` is a powerful tool with a confusing interface. Many struggle with commands beyond `git add`, `git commit`, `git pull`, and `git push`, because the underlying model for `git` is poorly communicated. But once a user has a thorough understanding of `git` internals, the reasoning behind its (admittedly rough) interface becomes much clearer, and the path to mastery becomes clear.\n\nRather than present the internals of `git` through dry explanation, this talk explains the internals of `git` through live coding and live interaction with a `git` repo. Our goal: to write a minimal `git` client from scratch without the help of any \"heavy\" libraries like `libgit2`. Instead, we'll cover the contents of `./.git`, how to interact with them, the \"theory\" behind `git` (e.g., what does it mean that `git` is an immutable, content-addressible store?), and slowly develop a tool to do basic `git` operations.",
