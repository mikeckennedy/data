  "description": "You've started to \"containerize\" your applications by writing a\nDockerfile or two, and now you want to run your containers in a cluster.\nBut Kubernetes is quite different from Docker: the smallest unit of\ndeployment is not a container, but a *pod*; pods are accessed through\nspecialized load balancers called *services*; there are *labels* and\n*selectors* everywhere; and everything is created by expressing desired\nstate with YAML, lots of YAML.\n\nIn this hands-on tutorial, we will learn about Kubernetes and its key\nconcepts, both in theory (we will become familiar with all the things\nevoked in the previous paragraph) and in practice (we will know how to\nuse them to deploy and scale our applications).\n\nKubernetes has the reputation of being a complex system with a steep\nlearning curve. We will see that it is, indeed, a complex system, but\nthat it is possible to tame its most essential features in just a few\nhours.\n",
