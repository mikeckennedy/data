  "description": "This talk introduces discovery about reference relation between PEP (Python Enhancement Proposals) obtained using NetworkX. \n \nNetwork analysis is an approach used to explore the relationship structure between \"something\" and \"something\" (e.g. friendship, network,  citation network).  By focusing not only on individual elements but also on relationships, you may get new insight. If you are a Python user, NetworkX will help you get started with network analysis.\n \nThis talk will also introduce a website that interactively visualizes PEP's reference relationships (https://github.com/komo-fr/pep_map_site).\n\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
