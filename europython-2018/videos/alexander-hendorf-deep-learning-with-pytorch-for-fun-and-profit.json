  "description": "There are all these great blog posts about Deep Learning describing all\nthat awesome stuff. - Is it all that easy? Let\u2019s check!\n\nWe\u2019ll look into: style transfer (making a picture look like painting),\nspeech generation (like Siri or Alexa) and text generation (writing a\nstory). In this talk I\u2019ll describe the whole journey: A fun ride from\nthe idea to the very end including all the struggles, failures and\nsuccesses.\n\nSteps, we\u2019ll cover:\n\n-  The data challenge: get the data ready\n\n-  Have it run on your Mac with PyTorch and an eGPU\n\n-  Creating a character-level language models with an Recurrent Neural\n   Network\n\n-  Creating a text generator\n\n-  Creating artwork\n",
