  "summary": "This talk will explore how garbage collection is implemented in CPython\nand PyPy. See how CPython deals reference counting's shortcomings with a\nspecial GC for cycle collection. Then dive into PyPy's sophisticated and\nhigh-performing GC implementations. The particularly thorny issue of\nfinalizers in reference cycles will also be addressed.\n",
