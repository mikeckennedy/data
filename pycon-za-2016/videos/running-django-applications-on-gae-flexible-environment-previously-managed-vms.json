  "description": "Google App Engine was made Generally Available in 2011 and supported\nPython, Go and Java runtimes. From that time , we have seen many popular\nPython web applications deployed on Google App Engine\u2019s Standard\nEnvironment. Even with the awesomeness of App Engine, Pythonistas felt\nlimited by what the standard environment offered.\n\nApp Engine Flexible Environment (Previously called Managed VM\u2019s) solved\nthe pain points that developers encountered: It allows developers to\ncustomize their Python runtime and even the underlying operating system\nusing Dockerfiles. App Engine automatically scales your web app and\noffers automatic load balancing.\n\nThis talk will explore how to implement microservices, authorization,\nSQL and noSQL databases, traffic splitting, logging, full text search,\nversioning, security scanning, memcache, and content delivery networks\nusing App Engine Flexible Environment. This will be shown in practice\nthrough the deployment of a Python/Django Application on the App Engine\nFlexible Environment.\n",
