  "summary": "Authors: Zinkov, Rob\n\nTrack: Machine Learning\n\nMany machine learning problems involved datasets with complex\ndependencies between variables we are trying to predict and even the\ndata points themselves. Unfortunately most machine learning libraries\nare unable to model these dependencies and make use of them. In this\ntalk, I will introduce two libraries pyCRFsuite and pyStruct and show\nhow they can be used to solve machine learning problems where modeling\nthe relations between data points is crucial for getting reasonable\naccuracy. I will cover how these libraries can be used for classifying\nwebpages as spam, named entity extraction, and sentiment analysis.\n",
