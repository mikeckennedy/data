Here I'd explain how it happened and what I learned in the process.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/WWPUGX\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
