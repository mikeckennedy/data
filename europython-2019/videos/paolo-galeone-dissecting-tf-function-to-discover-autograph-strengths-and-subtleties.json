  "description": "AutoGraph is one of the most exciting new features of Tensorflow 2.0: it\nallows transforming a subset of Python syntax into its portable, high-\nperformance and language agnostic graph representation bridging the gap\nbetween Tensorflow 1.x and the 2.0 release based on eager execution.\n\nUsing AutoGraph with the ``@tf.fuction`` decorator seems easy, but in\npractice, writing efficient and correctly graph-convertible code\nrequires to know in detail how AutoGraph and tf.function work.\n\nIn particular, knowing how:\n\n| - A graph is created and when it is re-used;\n| - To deal with functions that create a state;\n| - To correctly use the Tensorflow ``tf.Tensor`` object instead of\n  using the Python native types to speed-up the computation;\n\ndefines the minimum skill-set required to write correct\ngraph-accelerable code.\n\nThe talk will guide you trough AutoGraph and ``tf.function``\nhighlighting all the peculiarities that are worth knowing to build the\nright skill-set.",
