  "description": "Bruno Rocha (@rochacbruno) talks about how Flask encourages Application Factory Pattern for creating new application instances. Years ago I decided to leverage this pattern and use a wide application factory to build the whole Flask project. Using this approach we get rid of Circular import and app-out-of-context problems and also we have a better organization for our folder structure.",
