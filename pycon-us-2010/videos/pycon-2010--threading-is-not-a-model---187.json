  "description": "Threading is not a model\n\nPresented by Joe Gregorio\n\nWe have many concurrency/multiprocessing capabilities at our finger\ntips, such as threads, processes, locks, mutexes, select, epoll,\ntransactional memory, etc. But none of them are a model for\nmultiprocessing, they are only tools on which you would build an\nimplementation of such a model. So what are the models we can choose\nfrom? How would they be implemented in Python? And why may the GIL\nactually be a good thing?\n",
