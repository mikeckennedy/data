  "description": "Discover how IBM Cloudant engineers use data to inform development and\noperations every day! Sources such as Splunk and Graphite are pivotal\nfor meeting our service needs. I will demonstrate a data processing\nengine based on Pandas and NumPy that can help tame these sources.\nThen discover how you can use Jupyter notebooks with IBM's Bluemix\nplatform to do more with data.\n\nSnakes on a Cloud: \"Data science, meet DevOps\"\n\nRunning an always-on database service such as IBM Cloudant is a\ncomplex task. Accomplishing this requires a mix of development and\noperations informed by data.\n\nVarious data sources such as application logs, system metrics, and\nproject management systems are used every day by Cloudant engineers.\n\nFirst I'll describe how DevOps works at Cloudant, and how data is used\nto meet our service needs. Break through the buzzwords and see the\nreality of a running service.\n\nI'll demonstrate a data processing engine called Forecast, which\ncombines various sources at Cloudant for analysis. Forecast allows\nengineers to go beyond manual inspection by using Pandas and NumPy to\nanalyze information. We'll see how we can realize new insights from\nour service metrics with tooling and automation.\n\nFinally we'll examine data using Jupyter Notebooks as provided by IBM\nBluemix's data science platform. I'll walk us through visualization of\nForecast's output and we'll learn how Bluemix can make data science\nsimpler.",
