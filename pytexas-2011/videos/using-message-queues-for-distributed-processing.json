  "description": "About six months ago we moved our account provisioning process from a\nmonolithic Perl script to a set of distributed, interconnected python\nscripts. By using message queues (specifically beanstalkd) to pass\nmessages between the processes, we were able to build a system that was\nmuch faster, more reliable and more flexible.\n\nI will walk through the process that led us to choose beanstalkd, look\nat some alternatives that are available, and describe some use cases for\nmessage queues.\n",
