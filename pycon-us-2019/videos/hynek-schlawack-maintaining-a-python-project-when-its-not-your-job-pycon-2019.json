  "description": "PyPI is a gold mine of great packages but those packages have to be\nwritten first. More often than not, projects that millions of people\ndepend on are written and maintained by only one person. If you\u2019re\nunlucky, that person is you!\n\nSo how do you square delivering a *high quality* Python package you can\nbe proud of and having only limited time at your disposal? The answer is\nnot \u201ctry harder,\u201d the answer is to **do less**.\n\nThis talk will help you get there by talking about how you can make your\nlife easier, remove causes of friction with your contributors, and\nempower said contributors to take over tasks that you can\u2019t make time\nfor anymore.\n",
