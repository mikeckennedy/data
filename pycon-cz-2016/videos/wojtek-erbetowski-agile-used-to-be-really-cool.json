  "description": "Agile software development used to be really cool back in the 00's.\nThe vision of old school waterfall projects, with months of work\nbefore integrating and releasing software to users gives me the\ncreeps. But let's return to the present. I can hardly even recall\nworking in a non-agile project. I feel that most of the Agile\nmanifesto principles are in my DNA more than a thing to follow. If\nyou want to keep growing in this industry you might want to start\nbuilding on top of that. This presentation contains my experience\nabout aligning people, sharing a direction, and how servant\nleadership works.",
