  "description": "\"ADHDidn't: 7 Things That Wrecked My Productivity During WFH, and How I Dealt With Them\" by: Eli Holderness\nI\u2019m just going to say it: I\u2019m Bad at working from home. That\u2019s a problem, because I\u2019ve been doing it for the last year, it looks like we might have more than a little while to go yet before office life resumes, and my ADHD isn\u2019t exactly going anywhere in the meantime.\n\nEven aside from the myriad ways that remote working can expose issues in a company\u2019s management or communications infrastructure, there are a whole host of problems that can arise on a personal level. In this talk, I discuss some of the ones I\u2019ve grappled with over the last year.\n\nCan\u2019t stay focused? End up endlessly doomscrolling, or procrastinating for hours before really starting to work for the day? Trouble sleeping, or zoning out during the day with nobody around to keep you on track? If that sounds familiar, stop by and maybe get some ideas of things you can do about it - or at least feel less alone!\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
