  "description": "To defend against attacks, think like a hacker. But does that mean you need to be a DevOps expert? Security researchers today need to discover new attack techniques. However, much of their focus is diverged to backend coding. We share how to build an infrastructure for researchers that allows them concentrate on business logic and writing hacker \u201ctasks\u201d. Using Python, Celery, Docker and Kubernetes on Google Cloud, these tasks can then be performed in parallel and without a lot of DevOps hassle. Our technique removes two common barriers: first, long and risky deployment processes and second, low transparency within the production system.\n\nPromise to share the stupid things too.",
