  "description": "This talk will discuss joint work between the xtensor and Apache Arrow open source projects, which can help enable the development of machine learning and other numerical computing applications. xtensor provides efficient multidimensional array computing for C++14 using expression templates, with Python bindings and NumPy interoperability. Apache Arrow provides cross-language array metadata and shared memory IO for moving tabular and tensor-like array data efficiently between compute environments.",
