  "abstract": "Big data promises to expand our understanding of human behavior by\nopening large swaths of it to empirical analysis. Yet, due its size and\nheterogeneity, behavioral data poses many analytic and algorithmic\nchallenges, which can confound analysis and make it hard to identify\ninteresting phenomena in data. By dissecting the data into more\nhomogenous subgroups, our method can systematically uncover surprising\nsubgroups that behave differently than the rest of the population. We\napply our fully automatic method to three different datasets,\nStackExchange, a Q&A website, KhanAcademy and Duolingo, online learning\nplatforms and we get good results for it.\n",

  "description": "This package takes a step toward solving the problem of large size and\nheterogeneity of behavioral data, by automating discovery from data by\nleveraging Simpson\u2019s Paradox. The paradox is a phenomenon wherein the\nentirety of a population behaves differently or in some cases even\nopposite to the trend observed in the underlying subgroups\n",
