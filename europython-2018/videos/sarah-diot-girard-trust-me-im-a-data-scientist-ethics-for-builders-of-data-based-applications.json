  "description": "Data Science is gonna save the world, right? Or is it? Machine Learning\nepic fails are being largely commented. It\u2019s easy to convince ourselves\nthat they are due to the inconsiderate misuse of Data Science. But is it\nreally so? Is it possible that innocuous choices lead an honnest team to\na disaster?\n\nDuring the course of this talk, we will build together an (imaginary)\napplication: a disruptive AI-based smart virtual assistant, pledging to\nhelp high-schoolers with their university choice. We will see how\nunintended biaises may creep in at every step, even with the best of\nintentions. We will explore different topics, such as algorithmic\nfairness, model interpretability and the handling of minority classes.\n\nThrough this practical example, this talk will present a review of major\nethical pitfalls identified in the Machine Learning community along with\nsuggestions on how to avoid them.\n\nThis talk is intended for beginner to intermediate Data Scientists, and\npeople working with Data Scientists, even without specific technical\nknowledge.\n\nSlides :\nhttps://sdgjlbl.github.io/Presentations/Data%20Science%20and%20Ethics/presentation.html#/\n",
