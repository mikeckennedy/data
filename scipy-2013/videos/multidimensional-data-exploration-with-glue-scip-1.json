  "summary": "Authors: Beaumont, Christopher, U. Hawaii; Robitaille, Thomas, MPIA;\nBorkin, Michelle, Harvard; Goodman, Alys\n\nTrack: General\n\nModern research projects incorporate data from several sources, and new\ninsights are increasingly driven by the ability to interpret data in the\ncontext of other data. Glue (http://glueviz.org) is a graphical\nenvironment built on top of the standard Python science stack to\nvisualize relationships within and between data sets. With Glue, users\ncan load and visualize multiple related data sets simultaneously. Users\nspecify the logical connections that exist between data, and Glue\ntransparently uses this information as needed to enable visualization\nacross files. This functionality makes it trivial, for example, to\ninteractively overplot catalogs on top of images.\n\nThe central philosophy behind Glue is that the structure of research\ndata is highly customized and problem-specific. Glue aims to accomodate\nand to simplify the \"data munging\" process, so that researchers can more\nnaturally explore what their data has to say. The result is a cleaner\nscientific workflow, and more rapid interaction with data.\n",
