  "description": "When you learn a new language, like French or German or even English,\nyou first learn how to read. Then you learn how to write. When you learn\na new *programming* language, you first learn how to write. And that\u2019s\nit.\n\nImagine that you were never formally taught how to read. And that you\nwere told that you should just figure it out \u2026 by writing \u2026 a whole\nbunch. How would that even work? I don\u2019t think it would.\n\nIf you can\u2019t read. You can\u2019t write. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nDo you think that Shakespeare would be Shakespeare if he never read a\nsingle book in his entire life? No. Nothing is created in a vacuum. Good\nwriters are good writers because they\u2019re good readers.\n\nJust as reading is an invaluable skill so to is reading code. It\u2019s a\nskill that\u2019s never formally taught. But it\u2019s a skill that is essential\nnonetheless. In this talk I\u2019ll show you how to effectively read code so\nthat might write better code.",
