  "description": "A number of Python features often seem counter-intuitive at first glance, especially when moving from another programming language to Python. Often what at first seems like a bug, will later reveal itself to be a misunderstood feature.\n\nDuring this talk we'll look at a number of Python's unique features and quirks and attempt to re-shape our mental models of Python to better match reality. By the end of this talk you'll have a deeper understanding of Python's rules behind objects, scope, and variables.\n\nWarning: this talk will include many Python head scratchers so show up prepared to think on your feet!",
