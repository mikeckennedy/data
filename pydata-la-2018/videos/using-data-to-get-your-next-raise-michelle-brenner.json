  "abstract": "This talk will consist of two main parts. After outlining the difficulty\nof annual reviews with a real life example, I will explain the manual\nsolution of success statements. A success statement is a sentence that\nexplains a single achievement and how it contributes to the bottom line.\nThis is a great place to start, but can be tedious to add up all the\ninformation for reports. The second part is about the app I created and\nhow you can use it to store and automatically summarize the data\nmultiple ways. I\u2019ll get into the different ways to manipulate the data\nand how to deploy the app to have a personal ROI Tracker.\n",

  "description": "Most people dread the annual review process. It is difficult to remember\neverything you have done and summarize it in a concise, clear way. As\nengineers, there is the additional factor of translating technical\nachievements into a format business folks can understand. I propose a\nsolution for tracking and reporting achievements in a way that\u2019s simple\nand easy for stakeholders to understand.\n",
