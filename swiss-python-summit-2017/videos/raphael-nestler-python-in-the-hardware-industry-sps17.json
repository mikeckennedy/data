  "description": "This talk will be about the usage of Python inside of Sensirion, a hardware company producing sensors. We will see where and how we rely on Python and how the usage evolved from collections of small Python scripts in each department to a stack of gerrit, Jenkins and devpi to develop, test and deploy Python packages to 100+ non software engineers in the lab.\n\nTalk recorded at the Swiss Python Summit on February 17th, 2017.\n\nLicensed as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International",
