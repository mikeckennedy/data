  "description": "After half a lifetime \"undercover as a man\" I transitioned from male to\nfemale while staying involved in the Python community. This talk\ndiscusses that transition and explores how I found life in Python as a\nwoman different from my former life as a man and the lessons about\ndiversity I have learned.\n\nThis talk will include a brief discussion of what being transgender\nmeans, my experiences as I came to terms with it, and the losses and\ngains transition entailed. Early on I made the decision to be as open as\npossible and to stay engaged in the Python community as I transitioned\nand I will discuss why I made that decision and the levels of acceptance\nand support I encountered.\n\nTransition has been wonderfully successful, but that very transition put\nme in a surprisingly different world. Now being part of not one, but at\nleast 3 groups that are minorities in the Python world gave me a very\ndifferent view of a community I thought I knew, and pushed me to being\nan activist (or trouble maker) in spite of myself. In addition to the\nmany positives the Python community has offered me on my journey, I will\ndiscuss the experiences that have made me understand that privilege is\nvery much alive and well in the Python world.\n",
