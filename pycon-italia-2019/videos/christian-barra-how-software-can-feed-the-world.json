  "description": "Infarm is a FaaS, Farming as a Service, and whether you believe it or\nnot, our business is in-house farming at scale.\n\nWe design and build our farms, grow vegetables and sell them, and the\nbackbone of our infrastructure is based on Python.\n\nMore than 10 million observations recorded from our farms, rapidly\nincreasing given our expansion to new markets, feed our farm management\nsystem that allows the operators, plant scientists, and supervisors to\nmonitor each farm in real-time.\n\nDuring this talk I will introduce our IoT infrastructure, how we use\nPython and how we plan to improve the capabilities of our farms by\nadding edge machine learning.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1785\n\nin \\_\\_on **Saturday 4 May** at 18:45 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
