  "description": "Agile methodology is mostly used by project management and software teams for creating a predictable software release timeline. Agile output is measured in form of sprint metrics such as burndown chart, cumulative velocity etc . Usually commercial project management tools provide user stories management and metrics out of the box. Many organizations do not have these expensive tools due to costs and budget or historical choices. This talk describes how daily agile metrics can be generated using Python for any reasonable project management tool that has an Agile template and a webservices API.",
