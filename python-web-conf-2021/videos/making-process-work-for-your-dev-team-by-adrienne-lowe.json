  "description": "\"Making Process Work For Your Dev Team\" by: Adrienne Lowe\n\n\u201cI hate process.\u201d Ever heard anyone say that? If you\u2019ve worked on a team with slow, inflexible, and bloated processes that led to poor communication and low morale, you've got every right to say it! But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Process can be a force for good on your team: for enhancing communication and alignment, for documenting shared values and commitments, and for making our work more inclusive and accessible to folks beyond our immediate team.\nIn this talk, you'll learn the how and why of creating and refining processes that have better buy-in, more flexibility, and more closely reflect the changing reality of our teams and goals. Whether you're a developer or a manager, and regardless of which \"flavor\" of Agile is your favorite (or not), you can be a force for good on your team by advocating for processes that are changeable, adaptable, documented, and have evaluation built in. Come learn how!\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
