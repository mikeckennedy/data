In this video, I'll discuss some common methods and attributes, and show you how to tell the difference between them. (Hint: It's all about the parentheses!)\n\nThis is video 4 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
