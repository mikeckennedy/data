  "description": "**Anne Matthies** (@babeltron)\n\nAnne Matthies has been coding data stuff professionally since 1996. She switched to Python 2 in 2000, to Python 3 in 2015. Currently, she\u2019s working at Babbel, Berlin, responsible for building and operating the data platform \u2013 and developing the next generation.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nSo you\u2019ve decoupled your code monolith into all those micro chunks. When someone asks \"How can I\u2026\" you want to answer: \"That\u2019s easy! We\u2019ve built that.\" Actually, you\u2019ve built all parts needed for that. Who plugs them together? And how?\n\n**Description**\n\nKeeping the grip on decoupled code using CLIs\n\nSo you\u2019ve decoupled your monolith spaghetti code into micro chunks. You\u2019ve switched to infrastructure as code, and you\u2019re confident that it scales horizontally. Your data pipelines are pretty resilient, your CI pipeline runs tests on every single git push.\n\nAnd then, you get a new team member. Or your CTO wants to plot data of his brandnew sandbox project that isn\u2019t integrated into your pipelines. Or someone just asks \"How can I\u2026\" and you want to answer: \"That\u2019s easy! We\u2019ve built that\u2026 \u2013 Well, actually, we\u2019ve built all parts needed for that.\" Who plugs them together? And how?\n\nIn my talk, I\u2019d like to show how lightweight CLIs can be Ariadne Threads through the labyrinth of micro components. How at Babbel we use conda, setuptools entrypoints and simple CLI scripts to keep the grip on our data platform code chunks\n\n\n**Recorded at** PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: https://de.pycon.org/\n\n**Video editing**: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\n\n**Tools**: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",
