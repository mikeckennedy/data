  "description": "If you've ever seen a talk on containers or Docker, it usually goes\nsomething like this: A \"hello world\" app is deployed and massively\nscaled up using some kind of magic framework or API. Nothing short of a\nmagic trick, we usually feel impressed but have no idea what just\nhappened. This talk is an intro to containers as explained by a Python\ndev for Python devs, without the magic tricks.\n",
