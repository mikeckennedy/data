  "description": "Data science once involved working with a large data set in relative\nisolation and producing a static report to present at a quarterly\nmeeting. Decision makers in companies have been inspired by the types of\ninsights the data can offer and are asking more questions of it, such as\nwhat happens if I change this variable or where did this result come\nfrom. Data scientist regularly now present their analysis not in reports\nbut in web apps or behind APIs that allow this kind of interrogation. We\nhave been building data science solutions for 10 years and have learnt\nmany lessons along the way. In this talk we will run through how to\nbuild performant, scalable and validated data science web apps, using\npython.\n",
