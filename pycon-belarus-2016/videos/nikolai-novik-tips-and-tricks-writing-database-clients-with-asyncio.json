  "description": "Asyncio - is young library for asynchronous network programming. For\nalmost two years asyncio community have written a lot of drivers to\ndifferent databases. Nevertheless, there are still a lot of libraries\nthat need to be ported or written from scratch. Lack of information on\nproper use and writing code in asyncio slows down asyncio adoption.\nNikolay will talk about how to write your own client for database or\nmessage queue using asyncio and protocol pipelining, also he will give\noverview of internals for most popular database libraries: aiopg,\naiomysql, aioredis and aioodbc as well as bunch of asyncio tips and\ntricks.\n",
