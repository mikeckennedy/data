  "description": "Ever felt fed up with digging photos out from thousands of images?\nShould you group them by time or content? Want to tag not just your\nfriends, but also your pets? You know about some paid online services,\nbut they are not as tailor-made, and you want to keep the photos to\nyourselves? Why not DIY? With image recognition by deep learning neural\nnetworks, tedious photo tagging and searching steps can be much\nsimplified. Amidst the sea of selfies, skies, and food of a \u201cKong\ngirl\u201d\u2018s collection, you\u2019ll find a better way to ease your life.\n",
