  "description": "Royal FloraHolland is the biggest flower auction in the world. And next to handling a lot of plants and flowers, we also handle a lot of pictures of plants and flowers. Pictures that need to be of a certain quality. We built a fully automized self-improving system to check the image quality by using deep learning models, asynchronous API technologies and Docker/AWS/Gitlab.",
