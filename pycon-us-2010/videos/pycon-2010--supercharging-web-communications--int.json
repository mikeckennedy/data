  "description": "Supercharging Web Communications: Integrating Python-based Apps with\nSalesforce.com CRM\n\nPresented by Christopher Johnson\n\nSalesforce.com is a leading provider of Customer Relationship Management\n(CRM) for enterprises (over 55,000 customers) and nonprofits (over 6,000\ncustomers). While it handles sales, marketing and support processes, it\ncan be extended to automate any business process, making it a core part\nof business operations. Python developers working with companies using\nsalesforce.com need to be able to integrate applications with\nSalesforce. Luckily, Salesforce.com has an elegant and powerful SOAP\nAPI. This presentation will introduce an example of using the Python\nwrapper for the Salesforce.com API (Beatbox) in an interactive website.\nWhile the library itself is powerful and can be used in custom Python\napplications, the Python community can also leverage the advanced\nintegration between the Plone Content Management System (CMS) and\nsalesforce.com. We will demonstrate how a Plone website can post forms,\necommerce transactions, and event RSVPs to salesforce. Additionally, we\nwill show how developers can make Salesforce.com data interactive in a\nPlone website.\n",
