  "description": "CUDA technology permits to exploit the power of modern NVIDIA GPUs. In\nthis talk, after a brief introduction to GPU architecture, we will focus\non how CUDA got inside Python through libraries like PyCUDA and others\u2026\n\nBy some examples we will show the main concepts and techniques for good\nGPU programming.\n\nThis talk targets anyone who wants to know how to exploit this\ntechnology from Python, the suitable use cases, the using techniques and\nthe do-not-using techniques to get the best from his own GPU\n",
