  "description": "In the intersection of mechanics, mathematics and \u201ccool stuff that travels through space\u201d lies Astrodynamics, a beautiful branch of physics that studies the motion of spacecraft. Rocket launches have never been so popular thanks to companies like Space X, more and more investors pay attention to aerospace startups and amazing missions explore our planet and our Solar System every day. In this talk we will get to know poliastro, a pure Python library that we can use to compute orbital maneuvers, plot trajectories and much more. The role of JIT compiling (using numba) to replace old and busted FORTRAN algorithms will also be discussed, as well as the importance of open source in scientific discoveries.",
