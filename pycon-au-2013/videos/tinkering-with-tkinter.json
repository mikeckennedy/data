  "summary": "Tkinter - the Python wrapper to the Tk graphics library - has been part\nof the Python standard library since very early on. However, that\ninclusion hasn't translated into extensive use.\n\nThere was a very good reason for this. Tk's documentation was beyond\nawful. And if you managed to get over that hurdle, Tkinter apps looked\nawful - they had a woefully inadequate set of widgets, styled with the\nvery best of mid 1990's open source graphic skill.\n\nAnd then, the world got obsessed with web frameworks, and the desktop\nwas declared as dead.\n\nHowever, in the last few years, many of the reasons Tkinter was ignored\nhave been quietly fixed. Tk 8.4 massively improved the visual appearance\nof Tk. tkdocs.com has emerged, addressing many of the problems with Tk\ndocumentation.\n\nIn this talk, you'll get a re-introduction to an old friend, and an\nexplanation of why, in a web and mobile world, you should care.\n",
