  "description": "The James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to Hubble, is NASA's upcoming flagship astrophysics mission and one of the largest scientific projects in history. Its Data Analysis Tools are written almost entirely in Python. I will provide an overview of these tools, and describe some of the technical aspects of how they leverage and contribute to the wider Python scientific ecosystem. I will also describe some of the unusual sociological and organizational elements of this effort that arise from the 3-way collaboration between academic scientists, NASA funded engineers/developers, and the Open Source Astropy project.",
