  "description": "reno is a tool for managing release notes in projects that support\nmultiple branches of development, and releases, simultaneously. It\nsolves the problem of managing release notes within patches that fix\nbugs, and makes it easier to cherry-pick changes between branches\n(allowing backports or forward ports). This talk will cover the\nrequirements, and constraints, that led us to design and build reno. I\nwill also show how to use it to create notes and publish them in your\npackages and via Sphinx-based documentation. Then I will talk about the\nimpact reno, and the release notes publishing automation, had on our\nproject and release processes.\n",
