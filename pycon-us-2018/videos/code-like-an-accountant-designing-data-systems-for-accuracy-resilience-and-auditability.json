  "description": "As engineers, we care a lot about the reliability of our applications. When a website falls over, pagers go off, and engineers burst into action to bring a site back to life.  Postmortems are written, and teams develop strategies to prevent similar failures in the future.\n\nBut what about the reliability of our data? Would _you_ trust financial reports built on your data?\n\nIf not, what can you do to improve data health? If you _would_ trust these reports, how can you prove to customers, investors, and auditors alike that they should too?\n\nIn this talk, you\u2019ll learn to apply strategies from the world of dev-ops to data. You\u2019ll learn about questions auditors ask that can help you pinpoint data problems. You\u2019ll also learn some accounting-specific tools for accurate and timely record keeping that I\u2019ve found fascinating and helpful!",
