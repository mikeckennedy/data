  "description": "Thanks to its world-class data tools and libraries, like Numpy, Pandas,\nJupyter, Matplotlib and xarray, Python is becoming the language of\nchoice in many scientific communities from Physics to Climate Science,\nfrom Earth Observation to Economy.\n\nA turn-key but less-know component of the scientific ecosystem is the\ndask library that enable seamless parallel, distributed and GPU\ncomputing in most cases without code changes.\n\nWe will use climate science as an typical example of a discipline where\nsimple tasks become easily big data problems and where mastering xarray,\ndask and dask.distributed is the key to turn them back into simple\ntasks, possibly on a large cluster of VMs (that you can easily provision\nfrom your preferred cloud provider).\n\nSlides: https://gitpitch.com/alexamici/talks/master?p=PyConX-2019\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1704\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 3 May** at 17:15 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
