  "description": "Web APIs are often called REST APIs, which recently became a part of\nthe everyday life of many Python developers. Sure, it can be a blast\nto build an API with frameworks like Django or Flask, but writing\ntests for it can be a tedious drag: asserting every single HTTP code,\nset of headers, JSON responses, error states\u2026 you know the drill.\nDespite all that you do, you still need to assure your API clients\nwon\u2019t be exposed to any unexpected surprises. At Apiary, we've\ndeveloped an Open Source testing framework called Dredd, which has\nbaked in first-class Python support. It does all the heavy lifting\nand boring stuff for you while allowing you to alter the test cases\nwith arbitrary Python code.\n\nLet Judge Dredd do your API justice.",
