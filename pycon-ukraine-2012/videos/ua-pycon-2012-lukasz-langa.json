  "description": "A look at possible approaches to introducing configurability to your Python application, and a quick analysis of the most common problems.\n\nToday's JSON will be tomorrow's XML. Convention over configuration or configuration over hard-coded defaults? Should the user be given the freedom to decide or should the programmer free users from confusion over too many options?\n\nThis talk presents answers to both sides of the argument. In the first part, I discuss different options for handling configuration in Python applications. Each will receive its share of benefits and problems, and some quick examples of how to use them in real code. In the second part, I describe things you can do right now to increase configurability of your existing applications.\n\nThe final part will briefly introduce the new configparser module from Python 3.2.",
