The first day saw 5,000 visitors\nand since then, over 50,000 people have attempted to \"guess the\ntypeface\" more than 5 million times.\n\nThe talk will cover:\n\n-  how we went from concept to design mockup to prototype\n-  game mechanics such as:\n\n   -  points\n   -  levels\n   -  badges\n   -  streaks\n   -  leader boards\n   -  stats (with lots of bayesian goodness)\n\n-  generation of glyphs with PIL\n-  mitigation against cheaters\n-  twitter integration\n-  migrating unauthenticated user data over on sign up / log in\n-  activity streams\n-  performance challenges\n-  database optimizations\n-  queuing of asynchronous tasks\n-  development of an API for use in an iPhone client\n-  deployment\n-  how we promoted and launched the site\n\nWe will also discuss various open source Django apps that have been\nextracted from the project and used on subsequent sites by us and\nothers.\n\nhttp://typewar.com/\n",
