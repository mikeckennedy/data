  "description": "What does network science have to say about the law? Can we determine\nwhich are the most the most influential cases in our legal system? Can\nwe understand how legal doctrine evolves? Using tools from network\nstatistics and data provided by Court Listener (an open legal data\nproject), we analyze the network of law case citations.\n\nCitation networks have recently been a topic of interest to network\nscientists. Court Listener, an open data initiative, provides the\nnetwork of law case citations as well as the text of (almost every)\ncourt case in the US. This network data set provides a rich array of\nquestions that are of interest to legal scholars as well as network\nscientists.\n\nCan we determine which cases are the most influential in our legal\nsystem? Can we understand how legal doctrine evolves? We will discuss\nwhat we learned about how the network of law cases evolves and what\nthis means for legal practitioners.\n\nInspired by this data set we develop new statistical methodology to\nmodel how networks evolve. We also provide new techniques to asses the\ngoodness of fit for both standard and novel probabilistic network\ngrowth models.",
