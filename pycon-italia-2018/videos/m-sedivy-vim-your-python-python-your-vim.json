  "description": "What do you use to write source code, docs, books or e-mails? Single\nbrain, single pair of hands, single keyboard, but a different keyboard\nlayout for each language and a different text editor for each purpose?\n\n--------------\n\nDo you use an IDE to work on Python code, then switch to an e-mail\nclient to write a message, then open a different editor to work on the\ndocumentation and finally ssh to a remote server to edit a configuration\nfile? Do you switch languages frequently or are your colleagues named\nM\u00fcller, Fran\u00e7ois, Mu\u00f1oz or even \u0160ediv\u00fd?\n\nI\u2019ll show you how I am happily typing in several languages on a single\nstandard US keyboard layout and why my CapsLock became so useful.\n\nI\u2019ll show you how I use a single editor on all my machines to produce\nall sorts of text, especially Python code with a few useful plugins.\n\nI\u2019ll show you my own plugin written in Python to hack my e-mails far\nbeyond imagination.\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 20 April** at 17:30 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
