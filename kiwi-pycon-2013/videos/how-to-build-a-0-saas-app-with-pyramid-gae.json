  "description": "@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Sunday, 08 Sep 2013 - Track 2\n\n**Audience level**\n\nIntermediate\n\n**Abstract**\n\nGiven the number of small businesses and not-for-profit organisations in\nNew Zealand, this talk is about sharing how I've used free software,\ni.e. the Pyramid web framework [1], on top of a free hosting service,\nGoogle App Engine. Pyramid is a 'non-opinionated' web framework and\ntherefore enables you to pick-and-choose what packages you'd like to use\nin your software stack, making it very flexible and easy to develop your\ncustom application with. I'll go through some of the features of Pyramid\nthat we're using in our app with code examples. I'll also briefly cover\nsome of the other free web services we're using in our app and how these\nall fit together with the Pyramid-based app.\n\n[1] http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/tim-knapp-how-to-build-a-0-dollars-saas-app-with-pyramid-and-gae\n",
