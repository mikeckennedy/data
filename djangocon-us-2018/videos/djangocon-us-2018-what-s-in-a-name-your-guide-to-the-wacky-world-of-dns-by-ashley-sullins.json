  "description": "So, you built a Django application. That\u2019s great! Now, how do you get\nthe app connected to your fancy domain name for the world to see? During\nthis talk, you\u2019ll learn about the phone book of the internet, otherwise\nknown as the Domain Name Systems (DNS). We\u2019ll go over topics such as:\nwhy DNS was created, how it works, and why it\u2019s important for developers\nhave a good understanding of DNS.\n\nAs a web developer who has launched hundreds of websites, I\u2019ll tell you\nstories of some of my own DNS disasters and odd quirks that I\u2019ve ran\ninto over the last 5 years. If you\u2019ve ever wondered why you can see your\nnewly launched website but your coworker can\u2019t, or if you\u2019re ready to\nlaunch your first client website, but not take down their email in the\nprocess, you won\u2019t want to miss this talk.\n",
