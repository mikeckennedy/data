  "description": "Thomas is a cyber security management student with autism. Gail is a\nuniversity lecturer in programming and cyberpsychology. They have had\nsome interesting conversations and Thomas isn\u2019t the only one who has\nlearned a lot this year.\n\nIn this talk, Thomas will share his insights into common higher\neducation practices which can make it harder for people like him to\nlearn, and why cyber security education in particular could benefit from\nrecognising and addressing this. Gail will reflect on where she\u2019s got to\nin her own contribution to that process and invite suggestions for doing\nbetter.\n",
