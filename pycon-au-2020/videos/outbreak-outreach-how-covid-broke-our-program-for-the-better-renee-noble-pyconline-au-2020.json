But when pandemic strikes, is maintaining communities based around connecting with hundreds of like-minded people even possible? Is it even possible to run an online event that upholds our values? And will kids even want to sign up for more hours of online learning?\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll take you through how we devised a plan to keep the GPN spirit alive online, with a dynamic schedule of learning, socialising and fun! I\u2019ll show you the tech that made it all possible, tell you the lessons we learnt along the way, and let you in on some of the things we\u2019ll be keeping in the long term.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 09:15:00 2020 at Floperator",
