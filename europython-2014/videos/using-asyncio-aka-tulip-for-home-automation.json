  "description": "This talk will cover the new asyncio library in Python 3.4 (also known\nas Tulip) and will use the area of home automation as a case study to\nexplore its features. This talk will be based on code using Python 3.3+.\n\nHome automation is a growing area and the number of devices and\npotential applications is huge. From monitoring electricity usage to the\ntemperature inside or outside your house to remote control of lights and\nother appliances the options are almost endless. However, managing and\nmonitoring these devices is typically a problem that works best with\nevent driven applications.\n\nThis is where asnycio comes in, it was originally proposed in PEP 3156\nby our BDFL, Guido van Rossum. Asyncio aims to bring a clear approach to\nthe python ecosystem and borrows from a number of existing solutions to\ncome up with something clean and modern for the Python stdlib.\n\nThis talk will introduce asyncio and use it within the context of home\nautomation and dealing with multiple event driven devices. Therefore we\nwill cover asyncio and the lessions learned from using different devices\nin this context.\n\nSome of the devices that will be used include:\n\n-  Raspberry Pi\n-  RFXCom's RFXtrx, USB serial tranciever.\n-  Owl CM160 electricity tracker.\n-  Oregon scientific thermometers.\n-  Foscam IP cameras.\n\nThis talk will also briefly cover the previous solution I used which was\ndeveloped with Twisted and compare it briefly with my new code using\nasyncio.\n",
