  "description": "Shiny is a web application framework for R that makes it easy to turn\nanalyses into interactive applications. When a user changes input\nparameters using sliders, drop-down menus and text fields, the\nchanges are propagated through a reactivity graph into outputs like\nplots, tables and summaries.\n\nWhile Python is generally more powerful and easier to use for a web\ndevelopment than R, it lack a comprehensive Shiny-like framework.\nCurrent tools are either too complex (Flask, Tornado) or too trivial\nand lacking Shiny-like graph interactivity (Bokeh, Dash, Spyre,\nBowtie).\n\nWe will demonstrate those tools on a web app that for a given face\nfind look-alike actors / actresses and scientists. Then we will show\nhow to implement Shiny-like reactivity in our Python module glossy.",
