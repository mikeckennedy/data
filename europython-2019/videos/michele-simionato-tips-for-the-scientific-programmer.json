  "description": "This is a talk for people who need to perform large numeric\ncalculations. They could be scientists, developers working in close\ncontact with scientists, or even people working on finance and other\nquantitative fields. Such people are routinely confronted with issues\nlike\n\n| 1 parallelism: how to parallelize calculations efficiently\n| 2 data: how to store and manage large amounts of data efficiently\n| 3 memory: how to avoid running out of memory\n| 4 performance: how to be fast\n\nThe goal of the talk is to teach some lessons learned after several\nyears of doing numeric simulations in a context were micro-optimizations\nare the least important factor, while overall architecture, design\nchoices and good algorithms are of paramount importance.",
