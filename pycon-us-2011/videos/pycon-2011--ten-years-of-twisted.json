  "description": "Ten Years of Twisted\n\nGlyph Lefkowitz\n\nThe Twisted event-driven networking engine is well-known in the Python\ncommunity. However, only a few of its features are widely understood.\nThis talk will be a brief conceptual introduction to Twisted, followed\nby a survey of its features, their status, and how development has been\nproceeding over the years, with a special focus on the last two years of\nsponsored development.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis talk will begin with a brief introduction to Twisted architectural\nconcepts; a description of the event loop, connections, and timers. It\nwill then segue into the many different features that Twisted offers,\nincluding command-line tools for running an out-of-the-box\nzero-configuration HTTP server, DNS server, IRC server, and SMTP server.\nThis will also present the relative maturity and stability of each of\nthese areas of the code, with a special emphasis on what level of\nexpertise a developer should have before attempting to use them.\nFinally, I will describe some of the features that have been added to\nTwisted along the way, including some new and exciting developments that\nhave been happening recently.\n",
