  "description": "Django\u2019s life-blood is its contributors. This talk is about how we enable more contributors from across the community, how they (You!) can get involved, and how you can make sure that it helps your career.\nDjango looks like it\u2019s doing just fine: it\u2019s a popular framework in a popular language. We have major releases every six months. We have Django Girls, a Foundation (and Fellows), super conferences in glamorous locations, and more.\nBut the code is old and there\u2019s only the smallest number of people that regularly contribute. We need more. We need you!\nWhat\u2019s more, as good as we are elsewhere as a community, the group of contributors isn\u2019t as diverse as the community at large: there are clearly barriers to entry here. We\u2019re trying to change that, and we want to invite you to come and join-in.\nContributing to open source is great fun, it\u2019s a great learning opportunity, and it can really help your career.\nI\u2019m going to tell you how to get involved, and how to get support in that.\nImportantly I\u2019m going to tell you how to avoid the pitfalls.\nYou are qualified to contribute. More than that, your contribution is the future of Django. Come code!\n",
