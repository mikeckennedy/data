  "description": "In my presentation I will treat my story as a case study. I\u2019ll speak about my background, motivation, decision-making process, and finding self-confidence and belief that I can reach the goal. Hopefully not in a pompous or coach style, just to share a bit of inspiration and encouragement for people who feel the need to change something in their life. I\u2019ll also provide audience with some pragmatic information \u2013 I will briefly recommend sources that I used and consider to be valuable, present pros and cons of programming bootcamps, and other helpful tools and events. I will also speak about how I planned the learning phase and what I managed to do during that period. Finally, I will explain how I organized my study having very limited amount of spare time and I\u2019ll finish with a few thoughts and recommendations for people who think about or just started the process of change.",
