  "description": "If a Python application has lots of dependencies and requires specific\nversions of some of its dependencies, then users can easily get bored or\nfrustrated installing the application. To make the installation faster\nand have less side effects, application authors can create bundles which\ncontain the application, all its dependencies and possibly the Python\ninterpreter. This talk presents a way of creating bundles using\nStaticPython, and compares it to bb-freeze. StaticPython is a\nsingle-file statically linked version of Python for 32-bit Linux (i386),\ncontaining all standard and some extra Python modules and C extensions.\n\nLink to\n`slides <http://pts-mini-gpl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/staticpython/doc%20/slides_2011-06-23/pts_staticpython_2011-06-23.html>`__\n",
