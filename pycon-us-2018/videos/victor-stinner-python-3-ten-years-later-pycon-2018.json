  "description": "Looking back at Python evolutions over the last 10 years.\n\nPython 3.0 was released ten years ago (December 2008). It's time to look back: analyze the migration from Python 2 to Python 3, see the progress we made on the language, list bugs by cannot be fixed in Python 2 because of the backward compatibility, and discuss if it's time or not to bury Python 2.\n\nPython became the defacto language in the scientific world and the favorite programming language as the first language to learn programming.",
