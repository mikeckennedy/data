We will report\non progress that has been made with astropy since the last scipy\nconference. The past year has seen much growth in the number and quality\nof the core libraries in astropy and a public release. We will highlight\nthe new capabilities available, and outline the development plans for\nthe upcoming year. Finally we discuss the strategies for advertising its\ncapabilities and growing the documentation and tutorials available for\nusers and developers.\n",
