  "description": "For most travellers, online reviews play a major role when it comes to\nchoosing which hotel to stay in. But can we actually trust a hotel\nreview? And if yes, how can we select which are the most meaningful and\ninteresting for us among the billions available in platforms such as\nBooking.com, Tripadvisor, Facebook (just to mention a few)? For 10 years\nnow, at TrustYou we have built processes that analyze terabytes of hotel\nreviews at a global scale, and strive to understand what people complain\nabout or like in the hotels worldwide. Dealing with a huge amount of\nreviews written in tens of different languages - each having its own\nsubtle shades of meanings - is the challenge we work on everyday. In\nthis talk, we will show what goes on behind the scenes of the TrustYou\nMetareview and dive into the technologies and the algorithms that allow\nus to provide travellers with all the information they need to find the\nperfect hotel.\n",
