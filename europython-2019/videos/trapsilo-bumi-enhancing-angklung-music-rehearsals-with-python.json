  "description": "Angklung is a traditional musical instrument from Indonesia. This\ninstrument has a lot of variety in how it is performed; a common format\nis the orchestral format in which 15-30 players gather to form a team.\nPlaying Angklung in this way is fun but also presents some challenges\nthat are hard to solve manually.\n\nFirst, I will introduce you to the instrument and how it works/how it is\nplayed. Then, I will show you how Python-based algorithms can be used to\nease the pains of managing Angklung teams, by reading Angklung-specific\nsheet music and calculating the most optimal distribution of Angklung\nbased on several important factors.",
