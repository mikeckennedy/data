  "description": "In the deployment of a short-course on electromagnetic geophysics, we have been developing strategies for developing an \u201ceducational stack.\u201d Web-based textbooks and interactive simulations built using Jupyter notebooks provide an entry-point for course participants to reproduce content they are shown and to dive into the code used to build them. Our overarching aim is to make the geophysical concepts accessible and interactive: from first introduction, to research and applied work. We will share the tools we are using and discuss some of our learnings.",
