  "description": "Literature collection is a crucial process in all studies. It allows for the \ncomparison in the historical context of the research as well as how the \nresearch is different or original from what others have done. Not several \nyears ago, assembling sources was not an easy task. A major part of the \nproblem was overcome with the creation of various scholarly databases and \ncollections that live on the web.\n\nThe beauty of programming is that it allows repeated tasks such as harvesting \nthe web for data to be automatised; that is how the web scraping or web data \nextraction was created. Similarly, enabling an automatised process to scrape \nthrough the scholarly databases would greatly benefit researchers. \n\nThis has inspired the development of an open source library called Arcas \nwhich allows for web scraping of academic articles using open access APIs.\nAPIs such PLOS, IEEE, arXiv etc.\n\nMy proposal for EuroScipy 2017 is to introduce the library Arcas and how \nscraping online APIs was implemented in a sustainable and reproducible manner \nusing Python.\n\nFurthermore, to test the abilities of the library a data set was collected on\na specific topic. I am also proposing to give a very brief analysis on this \ndata set using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning \nalgorithms.",
