  "description": "The Central Pacific Ocean is a looking glass into both the past and\nfuture ocean. The recent ProteOMZ expedition provides >6 million\ndatapoints on the distribution of microbial proteins in this region,\ncoupled with >6000 chemical and physical measurements. We demonstrate\nour approach to analysis of this multivariate data using the Pandas,\nScikit-learn, Biopython, Bokeh, and METATRYP Python tools. We found\ninteractivity to be key in human lead pattern discovery. We discuss\nchallenges and solutions to piecing together multiple data types and\nPython tools, and discuss our experience as scientists learning to apply\nPython packages in our research.Presenter(s): Speaker: Noelle Held,\nWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution/Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology Speaker: Jaclyn Saunders, Woods Hole Oceanographic\nInstitution Speaker: Joe Futrelle, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\nSpeaker: Mak Saito, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n",
