  "description": "We live in a world of systems, and being software developers, we focus on\nthe technical things we build. But, we often forget the bigger system that\nwe are a part of. A system with technical and human parts that we have to\nnavigate daily. We need to acknowledge this to truly understand Software and\neverything around it.\n\nIn this talk I'll go over the different ways our own preconceptions and\nhumanity affects how we build software. By doing this we can see the entire\nsystem we are a part of from up above, understand , and navigate it better\nto ultimately change it for the better.",
