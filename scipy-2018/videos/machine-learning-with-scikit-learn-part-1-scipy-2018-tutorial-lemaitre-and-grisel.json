  "description": "This tutorial aims to provide an introduction to machine learning and\nscikit- learn \"from the ground up\". We will start with core concepts of\nmachine learning, some example uses of machine learning, and how to\nimplement them using scikit-learn. Going in detail through the\ncharacteristics of several methods, we will discuss how to pick an\nalgorithm for your application, how to set its hyper-parameters, and how\nto evaluate performance. This is a two part tutorial. Please register\nfor part one and part two. Prerequisite skills: NumPy, matplotlib\nPresenter(s): Speaker: Andreas Mueller, Columbia University Speaker:\nGuillaume Lemaitre, INRIA Saclay - Parietal team\n",
