  "summary": "Authors: Moore, Jason, University of California at Davis\n\nTrack: General\n\nThe SymPy Mechanics package was created to automate the derivation of\nthe equations of motion for rigid body dynamics problems. It has been\ndeveloped primarily through several Google Summer of Code grants over\nthree years and is capable of deriving Newton's Second Law for\nnon-trivial multi-body systems using a variety of methods: from\nNewton-Euler, to Lagrange, to Kane. The software provides essential\nclasses based around the concepts of a three dimensional vector in a\nreference frame which ease the setup and bookkeeping of the tedious\nkinematics including both kinematic and motion constraints. There are\nalso classes for the automated formulation of the equations of motion\nbased on the bodies and forces in a system. It also includes automated\nlinearization of the resulting non-linear models. The software can be\nused to solve basic physics problems or very complicated many-body and\nmany-constraint systems all with symbolic results. I will go over the\nbasic software design, demonstrate its use through the API along with\nseveral classic physics problems and some not-so-trivial three\ndimensional multi-body problems.\n",
