  "description": "At Dropbox, we\u2019ve always used Python to power our application for\nWindows, macOS and Linux (until recently, Python 2.7). Over the years, a\ngrowing lack of features and the need for outdated compilers/toolchains\nmade migrating to Python 3 a necessity. Join us to hear the tale of our\nunique journey from Python 2 to 3 and the lessons we learned along the\nway:\n\n-  We\u2019ll discuss the reasons that led to our decision to make the jump.\n-  We\u2019ll dive into how we sequenced the transition by using the C-API to\n   ship both versions of Python and choose one at runtime.\n-  We\u2019ll reveal the tools we used to enforce a hybrid (2/3) syntax for\n   over hundreds of thousands of lines of Python code.\n-  We\u2019ll discuss some of our most spectacular bugs and gotchas, and how\n   you can avoid them!\n",
