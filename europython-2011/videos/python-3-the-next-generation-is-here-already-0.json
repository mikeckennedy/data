  "description": "Python is currently at a crossroads: Python 2 has taken it from a quiet\nword- of-mouth language to primetime, with many companies around the\nworld using it and an ever-increasing global marketshare of the\nprogramming world. But now comes Python 3, the first version of the\nlanguage that is not backwards compatible with previous releases.\n\nWhat does this mean? Are all my Python programs going to break? Will I\nhave to rewrite everything? How much time do I have? When is Python 2\ngoing to be EOL'd? Is the language undergoing a complete rewrite and\nwill I even recognize it? What are the changes between Python 2 and 3\nanyway? Also, the next generation is already here, as Python 3 is over\ntwo years old now. What has been ported so far, and what is its current\nstatus? Are migration plans or transition tools available? If I want to\nstart learning Python, should I do Python 2 or Python 3? Are all Python\n2 books obsolete?\n\nWe will attempt to answer all of these questions and more. Join us!\n\nOUTLINE/TOPICS\n\n-  Python 2 vs. Python 3\n-  Introduction to Python 3\n-  Backwards Compatibility\n-  Generational Changes\n-  Key Differences\n-  Role of Remaining Python 2.x releases\n-  Transition & Migration Plans & Tools\n-  Futures\n\n",
