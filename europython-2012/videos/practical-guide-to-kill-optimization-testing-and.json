  "description": "Optimization, testing, tunning and design in sw. project can be both\nheaven or hell for a sw. development project. Python provides many tools\nto deal with these topics but by theirselves they could not be enough.\nThe talk tries to expose techniques, self failures/success and practical\ntips and hints to make the right choice at the right time. This talk\nwill expose optimization, testing, tunning patterns ( and other critical\ntopics ) of a python project and try to analyze the options python\nprovides ( such as packages, techiniques and patterns/anti-patterns ) to\ndeal with them. There is not one true way to deal with these topics and\nthe main goal of the talks is to provide practical examples/techniques\nand create an active discussion with the public. Main discussion topics:\nTesting ( modules and techniques ) Optimization and performance (\nanalysis of the problem, profiling and tuning techniques ) Debugging\nDeployment and automation Python traps\n",
