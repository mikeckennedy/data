  "description": "Much of what we want to do with data involves optimization: whether\nit's to find a model that best fits the data, or to decide on the\noptimal action given some information.\n\nWe'll explore the embarrassment of riches Python offers to tackle\ncustom optimization problems: the scipy.optimize package, Sympy for\ncalculus and code generation, Cython for speedups and binding to\nexternal libraries.\n",
