  "description": "The emergence of a variety of new workloads in machine learning and\nartificial intelligence has pushed the limits of existing systems for\ndistributed computing. We introduce Ray, a new system designed to\nsupport these workloads and to provide the required scalability,\nflexibility, and fault tolerance. Ray provides a lightweight API based\non dynamic task graphs and actors to flexibly express a wide range of\napplications. We discuss architectural and API design decisions and show\nhow to build high-performance applications on top of Ray. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/ray-project/ray.Presenter(s): Speaker:\nRobert Nishihara, University of California, Berkeley Speaker: Philipp\nMoritz, University of California, Berkeley Speaker: Ion Stoica,\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n",
