  "description": "The pandas library is a powerful tool for multiple phases of the data\nscience workflow, including data cleaning, visualization, and\nexploratory data analysis. However, the size and complexity of the\npandas library makes it challenging to discover the best way to\naccomplish any given task.\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll use pandas to answer questions about multiple\nreal-world datasets. Through each exercise, you'll learn important data\nscience skills as well as \"best practices\" for using pandas. By the end\nof the tutorial, you'll be more fluent at using pandas to correctly and\nefficiently answer your own data science questions.\n\nParticipants should have an intermediate knowledge of pandas and an\ninterest in data science, but are not required to have any experience\nwith the data science workflow. Datasets will be provided by the\ninstructor.\n",
