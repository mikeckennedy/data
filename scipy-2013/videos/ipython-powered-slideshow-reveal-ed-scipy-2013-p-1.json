  "summary": "Authors: Avila, Damian, OQUANTA;\n\nTrack: Reproducible Science\n\nIn the last years, Python have gained a lot of interest in the\nscientific community because of several useful tools, well-suited to do\nscientific computing research, have been developed [1]. IPython [2], a\ncomprehensive environment for interactive and exploratory computing, has\narose as must-have application to run in the daily scientific work-flow\nbecause provide not only enhanced interactive Python shells (terminal\nand qt-based) but also an interactive browser-based notebook with rich\nmedia support [3]. The oral presentation of our research results to the\npublic (specialized and non-specialized) is one of the final steps in\nthe scientific research work-flow, and recently, the IPython notebook\nhas began to be used for these oral communications in several\nconferences. Despite the fact that we can present our talks with the\nIPython notebook or a derived static html through the nbviewer service\n[4], there is not a native IPython presentation tool aimed to easily\npresent our results. So, in this paper, we describe a new\nIPython-Reveal.js-powered slideshow, designed specifically to be\nrendered directly from the IPython notebook, and powered with several\nfeatures to address the most common tasks performed during the oral\npresentation and spreading of our scientific work, such as:\n\nMain slides (horizontal) Nested slides (vertical) Fragments views\nTransitions Themes Speaker notes Export to pdf To conclude, we have\ndeveloped a better visualization tool for the IPython notebook, suited\nfor the final step of our scientific research work-flow, providing us\nwith an enhanced experience in the oral presentation and communication\nof our results [5 - 6 - 7].\n",
