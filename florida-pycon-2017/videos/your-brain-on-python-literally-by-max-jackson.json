  "description": "In the near future, when you get sick, you\u2019ll be able to get treatment\nthat\u2019s been personally tailored to your exact situation. This is\npossible thanks to the \u201cBody-on-a-Chip\u201d, an emerging field of study in\nwhich human cells with your genetic material are grown into a miniature\nsystem that mimics the function of every major organ in your body.\n\nThese little systems generate a lot of data, and Python is a great way\nto gain insight into what these systems are doing and how they\u2019re\nresponding to a treatment. Data from the \u201cbrain\u201d of these systems, a\n\u201cbrain-on-a-chip\u201d made from real human neurons, is some of the most\nchallenging and exciting data that there is to analyze. We can gain\ninsight into how these brain cells are \u2018talking\u2019 to each other and how\nthey\u2019re reorganizing themselves, and how their ability to do these\nthings changes under different conditions. These insights can help guide\ntreatment decisions, give understanding into the basic nature of the\nbrain in general, and open up exciting new opportunities for\ntechnologies that sound like they\u2019re from science fiction.\n\nThis beginner-friendly talk will walk you through how it\u2019s done, from\ngetting the raw data to the final analysis, highlighting how everyone\u2019s\nfavorite language makes the whole endeavor a breeze.",
