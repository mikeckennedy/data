  "summary": "Authors: Zinkov, Rob\n\nTrack: Machine Learning\n\nInfer.py is a wrapper around Microsoft Research's Infer.NET inference\nengine. Infer.py allows you to represent complex graphical models in\nterms of short pieces of code. In this talk, I will show how many\npopular machine learning algorithms can be modeled as short\nprobabilistic programs and then simply trained. I will then show how to\nintrospect on the models which were learned and debug these programs\nwhen they don't produce desired results.\n",
