  "description": "REST is a standard for writing APIs, but there might be a better way. GraphQL is a query language which makes APIs more flexible and easier to evolve over time. It gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need which results in optimized bandwidth, server usage but also allows writing declarative UIs.\n\nThe talk will compare GraphQL with REST API to show the differences and advantages as well as real examples.\n\nMinistry of Python warns: This talk might include a bit of JavaScript.",
