  "description": "Starting a new project is always cumbersome, specially if you collaborate with others: you have to follow standards and agreements, there are some mandatory files, deploy artifacts and requirements should be in a certain place etc.\n\nIn this talk we will see how to create a repository template, talk about some standards you may follow and how to use Cookiecutter to initialize your project in a few seconds. We will also comment some CLI tools to help you maintain your repository up to date, with a special focus on how to easily handle environment variables.\n",
