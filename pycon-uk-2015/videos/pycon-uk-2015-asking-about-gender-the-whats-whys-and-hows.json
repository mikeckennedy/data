  "description": "As we move towards more customised experiences for our users, why do we\nstill insist of using the black boxes of male and female when asking\nusers about their gender? And why are we asking for it in the first\nplace?\n\nBetween 1 and 5 percent of the UK population identifies as having a\nnon-binary gender or are transgender. This talk aims to help developers\nask users about their gender in a useful and sensitive manner; educate\non what non-binary means and what other issues non-binary and gender\nvariant users may face when using the web.",
