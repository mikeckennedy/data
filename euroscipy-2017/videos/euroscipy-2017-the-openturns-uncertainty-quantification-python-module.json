  "description": "Uncertainty quantification is a set of methods which aim at estimating the uncertainties of engineering systems in order to mitigate risks.\nOpenTURNS is an open source C++ library for uncertainty propagation by probabilistic methods.\nHowever, most OpenTURNS users know its Python interface, which has gained maturity thanks to more than 10 years of development. \nIn this talk, we will present an overview of its interesting features, including the link with other Python packages. \nIn order to get a sense of what exactly OpenTURNS can do, we will present practical examples of the Python interface.",
