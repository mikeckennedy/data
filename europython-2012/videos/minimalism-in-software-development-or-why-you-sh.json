  "description": "Lean and agile promises - when implemented right - to reduce the pain of\nprocess and management overhead. As agile proponents say (the better of\nthem at least), this does not actually solve all our problems, it merely\nlets us see them clearer. And one thing that we can see clear once\nmanagement overhead goes down, is that we are perfectly able to create\nour own, technical, overhead. Developer culture and a tendency of\nsolving problems \u2018the usual way\u2019 can - and does - create complicated\nsolutions to simple problems, and regularly leaves us in configuration\nhell. This is a talk about frameworks and API:s, programming languages\nand data storage, and why we - developers - spend a large amount of time\nnot creating value. Even if we have the most perfect of agile\nimplementations with zero process overhead (yeah, right!), we still\nwaste time in development, and its all our own fault. I will discuss\nwhat we spend our time on, why any framework should be approached with\ntrepidation, and how we can do better than keep repeating the mistakes\nof yesteryear.\n",
