  "summary": "Since June 2013, disclosed by Edward Snowden, we learn more and more\nfacts about American and British spies' deep appetite for information,\neconomic spying and the methods they use to collect data. They\nsystematically tapped international communications on a scale that only\nfew people could imagine. But what are the consequences for societies\nwhen they now know about the NSA metadata repository capable of taking\nin billions of \"events\" daily to collected and analyze? Is there a way\nto defend against an agency with a monstrous secret budget?\n",
