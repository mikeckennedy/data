  "description": "In the runup to PyconUK 2014, I made the following ill-advised statement\nin an IRC channel: \"I feel like I should find something to talk about at\nPyconUK. I wish I had something interesting to talk about.\" Nine seconds\nlater someone replied \"create a markov chain to generate a talk from the\nnames of the talks at pycon and europython, then talk about how you did\nthat, using a title it generates as the title of the talk.\"\n\nChallenge accepted. This is that talk, admittedly one year late.\n\nIn this talk I will briefly describe Markov Chains as a means to\nsimulate conversations and graph databases as a means to store Markov\nChains. After this, I will discuss various considerations for creating\ninteresting candidate responses in conversations, along with the\nchallenges of too little and too much data. Finally, I will demonstrate\nmy implementation and generate the title of this talk.",
