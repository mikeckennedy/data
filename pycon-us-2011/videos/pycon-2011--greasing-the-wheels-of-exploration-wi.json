  "description": "The Mars Exploration Rovers (MER), Spirit and Opportunity, have been\nroaming the surface of Mars since January of 2004 leading to many\ndiscoveries about the nature and history of our sister planet. Each\nactivity requires a complex set of coordinated activites by a team.\nEarly in the MER mission the author automated much of the task of one of\nthe positions, the Payload Uplink Lead, for 7 of the 9 cameras on each\nrover. The system, called AutoPUL, is written in Python and that has\nproven to be the excellent choice for the development and maintenance.\nIn the talk I'll describe the Mars Rover mission and the operational\nactivities and how AutoPUL and Python fullfilled those needs.\n",
