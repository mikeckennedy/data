  "description": "Predictive analytics uses statistical and machine learning techniques to\nprovide a best assessment of what will happen in the future.\nUnderstanding the future can guide current decisions. This talk will\nprovide a quick guide on using deep learning approaches in building\npredictive models in python. It will give a brief introduction to\npredictive models, deep learning, Tensorflow and Thenao.\n\nAllaa Hilal Bio\n---------------\n\nAllaa R.
