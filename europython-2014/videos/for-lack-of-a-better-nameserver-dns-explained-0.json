  "description": "Following instructions of what entries to create where is easy enough\nwhen using a PaaS.\n\nBut DNS is hard \u2013 deployment issues always seem to come down to DNS.\n\nA solid understanding of DNS will not only help with deploying your\napplications, but will also give a greater understanding of how the\ninternet works, and more generally, distributed systems.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn what DNS is, how it works and how to\ncommunicate with it, and how Python can make both interacting and\nspinning up your own DNS server simple (I swear!).\n\nOutline:\n\n-  Intro (1-2m)\n-  What DNS is (5 min)\n\n   -  URL -> IP addr, e.g. \"phonebook\" lookup (obligatory pun: Call me,\n      Maybe?)\n   -  hierarchical system & resolution sequence (local DNS\n      cache/resolver, ISP resolver, recursive DNS search)\n   -  popular types (primary, secondary/slave, forwarding, authoritative\n      only, etc)\n   -  System components: what makes a DNS?\n\n-  How to communicate with DNS (3 min)\n\n   -  Protocol: UDP\n   -  Operations: CRUD\n   -  Resource records (A, AAAA, CNAME, SOA, SRV, etc)\n   -  tools: dig/nsupdate/nslookup\n\n-  Security overview (3min) (disclaimer: NOT a DNS security expert, not\n   planning to get into the details here)\n\n   -  Server-Server, DynDNS: TSIG/GSS-TSIG\n   -  Server-Client: DNSSEC\n\n-  Python + DNS (10 min)\n\n   -  plain UDP query in Python (no 3rd-party libraries/no magic)\n   -  Interacting with a DNS w/ Python (dnspython.py)\n   -  Sample DNS server with Twisted\n   -  \"fake\" demo (either local or pre-recorded screen cast) of\n      querying/updating/etc of the Twisted DNS\n\n-  Wrap up - resources page, github links, etc (1min)\n-  Q&A - ~5 min\n\n",

Maybe you've fixed a couple of entries, point some records\nto hostnames, waited patiently for new domains to resolve only to notice\nyour nameservers are incorrect. But what actually goes on with DNS? Come\nto this talk to find out how DNS works, and how to interact and create a\nDNS with Python.\n",
