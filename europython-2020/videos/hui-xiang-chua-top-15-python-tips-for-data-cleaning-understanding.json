  "description": "Data cleaning is one of the most important tasks in data science but it is unglamorous, underappreciated and under-discussed. These are some common tasks involved in data cleaning but not limited to: \r\n-\tMerging/ appending\r\n-\tChecking completeness of data\r\n-\tChecking of valid values\r\n-\tDe-duplication\r\n-\tHandling of missing values\r\n-\tRecoding\r\n\r\nMost, if not all, of the time, the datasets that we have to analyze are unclean. i.e. they are not necessarily complete/ accurate/ valid. This will impact the accuracy of our analysis if we do not clean them properly.\r\n\r\nThis talk covers how to perform data cleaning and understanding using primarily Pandas and Numpy. If you\u2019re new to data analytics/ data science and are interested how to use Python to perform analysis, or if you're an Excel user hoping to move to Python, this talk might be for you.\r\n\r\nParticipants should be at least familiar with the basics of Python programming.",
