  "description": "The NIST-developed Object-Oriented Finite Element code (OOF) is a is a long-standing project to develop a toolset for the segmentation, meshing, and finite-element analysis of microstructural images of materials, intended for the materials science audience, offering a materials-friendly GUI, a Python-based command-line, and Python and C++ APIs for extensibility.\nThe OOF development team has recently made substantial progress in expanding the scope of this tool to include history-dependent properties, motivated by crystal plasticity. In addition, we have an emerging interest in incorporating the OOF tool into new multi-scale materials analysis frameworks being built in the MGI. Among the challenges are the need to retain a high level of generality and ease of use while making these changes.\nThe team's development approaches to these recent modifications and emerging goals will be described.",
