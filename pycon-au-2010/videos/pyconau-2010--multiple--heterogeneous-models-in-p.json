  "description": "Multiple, Heterogeneous Models in Pylons\n\nPresented by Nick Seidenman (WEHI)\n\nThere is a fair amount of sparse, disjoint information available on how\nto use multiple, possibly diverse databases within a single Pylons app.\nThis talk seeks to present a coherent guideline, derived from lessons\nlearned, on how to use several different data stores (sqlite,\npostgresql, mysql, flat files) simultaneously within the same pylons\nproject.\n",
