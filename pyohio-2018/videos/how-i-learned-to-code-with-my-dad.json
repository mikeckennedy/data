  "abstract": "My name is Alexander Preston, I\u2019m nine years old, and I love coding with\nmy Dad. To me, coding is like a \u201csport\u201d. It\u2019s a fun activity you can do,\nand become better at. I\u2019m hoping to become a video game developer,\nbecause (almost) everyone likes games. I learned about coding by\nwatching my dad, and asking what he was working on. I started\nprogramming by using Scratch on a Raspberry Pi and building some games,\nand now I\u2019m learning to code in Python with Minecraft. I think that lots\nof kids would love to code, and I\u2019d like to give some ideas about how to\nhelp them get started.\n\nIn this talk I, with some help from my dad, will show how you can use\nPython with Minecraft to connect to and control the world. We'll build\nbuildings, blow them up, see what happens when Zombies invade, and other\nfun stuff we come up with.\n",
