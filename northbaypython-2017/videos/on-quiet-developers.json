  "description": "Open Source contributions are one of the most common de facto means to judging the competency of engineers, despite frequently resulting in the further marginalization of already marginalized people. In this talk, I\u2019ll coin the term \u201cQuiet Developer\u201d for developers who are active, engaged, but to the eyes of many completely invisible for many reasons. I\u2019ll dive into how developers like us survive, how hiring practices around us need to change, what employers can do to empower us, and in doing so finally chip away at the monolithic idea of \u201ccommunity engagement\u201d, highlighting instead the many less-visible communities so many of us are part of.",
