  "description": "Networks encode complex information on all kinds of interactions. We\nlook at how a network perspective can reveal valuable information about\ncorruption in public procurement, internal collaboration at a\nmultinational firm, and the tone of campaigns on Twitter, all with the\nphenomenal NetworkX library. NetworkX is a highly productive and\nactively maintained library that interacts well with other libraries and\nenvironments. It inherits many Python strengths like fast prototyping\nand ease of teaching. We also discuss alternatives like graph-tool and\nigraph.\n",
