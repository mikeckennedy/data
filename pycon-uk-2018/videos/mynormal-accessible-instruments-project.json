  "description": "Representing disabled voices in the music industry\n\nWe are an engineer and a musician who were brought together by our\ndesire to give a voice to those underrepresented in the music industry.\nWe sought to give disabled individuals high quality music and technology\nopportunities. Through the MyNormal project at Ark T Centre, we\ndeveloped workshops and Hackathons around building accessible\ninstruments. Inspired by Imogen Heap's mi.mu gloves, we use micro:bits,\nMakey-Makeys, laptops, speakers, bananas, and cubes to empower\nindividuals to interact with music in ways they've never done before.\nScienceOxford is supporting the project, lending kit, equipment, and\nmachine time.\n\nProject leaders are Hannah Bruce, Youth Music Project Manager at the Ark\nT Centre and bassist of Death of the Maiden; Noelle Aly, Projects\nTechnology Officer and Maker at ScienceOxford.",
