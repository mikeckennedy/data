  "description": "In this talk Maurits will introduce the problem of personalization and\ndiscuss some its peculiarities.\n\nOver ten years Maurits has been exploring different statistical methods\nto efficiently learn \u201cwhat to do to whom\u201d. His work has been applied\nvarious fields such as marketing (who should we target with our\nretention campaigns?) and healthcare (which type of treatment has the\nbest expected outcome for the current patient?). In this talk Maurits\nwill introduce the problem of personalization and discuss some its\npeculiarities. Maurits will focus on two contemporary challenges: First,\nhow should we \u2014 if we are lucky enough to be able to \u2014 setup experiments\nto learn \u201cwhat to do to whom\u201d through sequential experimentation?\nSecond, how can we learn, based on already existing data, what we should\ndo to whom in the future? This talk will cover some of the intuitions\nbehind effective sequential learning and offline policy evaluation, and\nwill highlight a number of tools and software packages developed by\nmember of Maurits\u2019 lab that enable you to get started right away.\n\nLab website: www.nth-iteration.com\n",
