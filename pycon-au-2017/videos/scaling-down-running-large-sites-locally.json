  "description": "At Eventbrite we have a moderately complex site - lots of different services, datastores, caches and other moving parts. It's all managed by our wonderful Ops team in production, and scaling up there is a problem we're working on, but what about scaling down? How do you get over a hundred moving parts to run on hundreds of developer laptops with limited RAM and big demands on productivity and development speed?\n\nWe'll go through how we developed a custom development environment based around Docker containers and a Python-based tool called `bay` that manages not only what containers to run but also how to interlink them, how changes propagate through the system, and how to keep up with all the changes streaming in from outside.",
