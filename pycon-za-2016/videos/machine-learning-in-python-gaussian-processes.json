  "description": "Any time you have noisy data where you would like to see the underlying\ntrend then you should think about using Gaussian processes. They will\nsmooth out any noise and give you a great visualisation of the error\nbars as well. Rather than fitting a specific model to the data, Gaussian\nprocesses can model *any* smooth function.\n\nI will show you how to use Python to:\n\n-  fit Gaussian Processes to data\n-  display the results intuitively\n-  handle large datasets\n\nThis talk will gloss over mathematical detail and instead focus on the\noptions available to the python programmer. There will be code posted to\ngithub beforehand so you can follow along in the talk, or just scoop up\nthe useful bits afterwards.\n",
