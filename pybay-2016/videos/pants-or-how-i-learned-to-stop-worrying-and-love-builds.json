  "description": "For integrated services, it makes sense to keep several logical Python projects in a single repository -- a common library, a web front end and a back end service. For such repositories, Pants (build in Python for Python, Java, C++ and more) helps maintain dependencies and build (mostly) stand-alone executables which simplify deployment.\n\u200b\nAbstract\nPants is a modern build system written in Python. It can build Python, Java, C++, Go and more. Twitter, Square and FourSquare use it internally, and contribute to it.\n\n**Bio:** \nMoshe is a Twisted contributor, and has contributed to core Python. He loves infrastructure for building, monitoring and making services highly available.\n\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/pybay2016/moshe-zadka-pants-building-python-for-fun-and-profit",
