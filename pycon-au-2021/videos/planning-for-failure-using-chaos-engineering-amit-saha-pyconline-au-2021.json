  "description": "(Amit Saha) Failure is just a fact of running software in production. But you can prepare for it in a controlled environment using Chaos Engineering techniques. In this talk, you will learn to make use of chaos engineering practices to plan and assess your production readiness. This means that you are more ready for the failure scenarios, when, not if, they happen.\n\nhttps://2021.pycon.org.au/program/QBWRZJ/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country\u2019s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 11:00:00 2021 at DevOops",
