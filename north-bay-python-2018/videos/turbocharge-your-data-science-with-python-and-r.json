  "abstract": "Python is an incredibly powerful language capable of handling all\naspects of the data science workflow:\n\n-  **ETLs**\n-  **Pre-learning:** Exploratory data analysis, data visualizations,\n   feature engineering\n-  **Learning:** Building machine learning & statistical models for\n   prediction or explainability\n-  **Post-learning:** Model evaluation and interpretability\n-  **Deployment**\n\nSo, why the heck would you introduce R into this framework? Because R is\nalso an incredibly powerful language capable of handling the entire data\nscience workflow. So, why not just use R? A better question is: why not\nuse both? The two languages can be used together to streamline this\nprocess. In this talk, you will learn how Python and R can be used to\ncomplement each other and produce higher quality results faster.\n",

  "description": "When working with data, should you use Python or R? Why not use both? By\nbeing language agnostic, you now have access to two great open source\nlanguages. This makes it easier to find and use already built\nmodules/packages, which improves the speed, quality, and impact of your\nresults.\n",
