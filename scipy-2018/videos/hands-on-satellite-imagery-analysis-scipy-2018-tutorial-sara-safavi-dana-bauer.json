  "description": "Satellite data is more widely available than ever before, and it is now\npossible for the public to access sub-weekly and even daily imagery of\nthe Earth's entire landmass. In this tutorial, you will gain hands-on\nexperience exploring publicly-available satellite imagery and using\nPython tools for geospatial and time-series analysis of medium- and\nhigh-resolution imagery data. At the end of the workshop, you will apply\nwhat you've learned to investigate real-world environmental and\nhumanitarian challenges. This tutorial is for intermediate Python\ndevelopers. It would help if learners attending this workshop also had\nsome familiarity with map data, but the instructors will not assume\nbackground knowledge of satellite imagery or geo- data tools. Learners\nwill come away from the workshop with: - a solid understanding of\nsatellite imagery and geo-data concepts; - strategies for wrangling,\nprocessing, and analyzing satellite imagery using several Python- based\nopen-source toolkits; - hands-on experience using satellite imagery to\nbetter understand and address real-world challengesPresenter(s):\nSpeaker: Sara Safavi, Planet Speaker: Dana Bauer, Planet\n",
