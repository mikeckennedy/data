  "description": "Do you already use our beloved micro-framework Flask but have a problem with the speed and scalability? We hear a lot of buzz with the new fancy asynchronous Python programming using async/await keyword to make our Python code run faster. But really how async works are still not spread well and the majority of Python programmer still not familiar using async/await keyword. In this talks, because Flask is not intended to support async (yet), we are will explore Quart, the Python ASGI web microframework. It is intended to provide the easiest way to use asyncio functionality in a web context, especially with existing Flask apps. This is possible as the Quart API is a superset of the Flask API. So you can instantly migrate your Flask app easily!",
