  "description": "Implementation of a Numerical Simulation in Python\n\nPresented by Jeffrey B. Armstrong\n\nThe Python programming language is well suited for numerical computation\nunder a variety of circumstances. Python offers advantages over\ncompeting free and commercial technologies, including price,\nfunctionality, and maintainability. Specifically, the combination of\nmature numerical libraries and liberal licensing allow complex\nsimulations to be coded with ease and to be made available to nearly all\ninterested parties. !NumPy/!SciPy, database access, networking, and\noptimization techniques are examined in detail with respect to numerical\ncomputation. A practical example involving an aerothermal commercial\nturbofan aircraft engine simulation showcases these advantages. An\naircraft engine is broken down into discrete stages, including\ncompressors, turbines, and other flow-related components. Commonalities\nbetween components, such as rotation and the presence of inlet and exit\nconditions, map cleanly to the object-oriented nature of Python. Based\non simulation needs and hardware availability, Python allows for the\nparallel computation of simulations without the expense and complexity\nof commercial parallelization packages.\n",
