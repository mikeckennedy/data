  "description": "In this talk, we will learn how to construct a general relativity raytracer in Python. Our goal will be to obtain synthetic images of black holes (similar to those observed in the movie Interstellar) by recreating how the light propagates in an environment of extreme gravity, such as a rotating black hole. Using this as an excuse, we will analyse different approaches to optimise our code as much as possible using all the tools available in the Python ecosystem. We will also learn how to construct efficient scientific simulations in Python that can match the speed of any other programming language.\n\nCopyright belongs to the speaker.",
