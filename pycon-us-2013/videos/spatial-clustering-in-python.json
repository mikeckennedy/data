  "summary": "Density-based clustering allows the identification of objects from\nunstructured data. The DBSCAN and OPTICS algorithms allow clustering and\nclassification of remotely-sensed points into objects; however, current\nimplementations have been unable to handle the data volume produced by\nLiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging). Using modified kd-trees as a\nspatial index allows for increased scalability.\n",
