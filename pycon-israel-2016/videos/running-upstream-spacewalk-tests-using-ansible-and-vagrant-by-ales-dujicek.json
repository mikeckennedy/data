  "description": "We have many tests for our product running in our test lab managed by Beaker. Unfortunately our community do not have access to this environment. And it would be too complicated for them to set up the same environment to test their contributions to upstream project. But we can provide them easy to use solution with Vagrant and Ansible. Vagrant is a tool for creating and configuring virtual development environment. And Ansible is configuration and management tool what can be used to configure Vagrant systems. I will introduce these projects, and show practical example how to use them to to set up testing environment for community contributing to upstream project of our enterprise application.\n\nSlides available here: http://il.pycon.org/2016/static/sessions/ales-dujicek.pdf",
