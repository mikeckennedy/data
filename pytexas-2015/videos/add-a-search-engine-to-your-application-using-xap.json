  "description": "Search is a key component of most modern web and mobile applications. If\nyou want to add a full text search engine to your Python application and\neffectively search large volumes of unstructured text, you could use\nXapian which is an open-source, light-weight and very fast C++ library.\nTargeted to Python developers, this talk aims at introducing Xapian and\nits Python bindings along with basic search concepts. We will show how\nto build your search engine using Xapian step by step. Topics such as\nindexing, stemming, querying and faceting techniques will be discussed\nwith code samples. A working prototype of a search engine built with\nXapian will be demonstrated in the end.\n\ndemo repo: https://github.com/jingle3276/imdb250 slides:\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wQVQig5Vdj5unQAkQQI8mELmX2zqjQ6S9OqeQIDqgoc/edit#slide=id.p\n",
