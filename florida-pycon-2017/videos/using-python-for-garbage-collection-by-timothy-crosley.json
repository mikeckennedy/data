  "description": "One of the major things that my wife and I have looked for wherever we\nmove is natural beauty and a good collection of public green space. So,\nwhen I walked by a park and creek reserve on the north end of our city,\nonly to find more trash than green space, I was mortified. Working\ntogether with several individuals from Reddit we got the park to a\nreasonably clean state, removing over 400 gallons of trash. The\nexperience made me realize, however, with over 480 parks, that as our\ncity grew we needed a more self-sustaining solution to this problem.\n\nAfter sharing the story on Reddit, one thing that struck me was how many\npeople were eager and capable of physically helping with the problem but\nhad insufficient supplies or funds, and how many people couldn\u2019t\nphysically help, but were eager to throw money at the problem. I\u2019m not\npolitical, and I certainly don\u2019t have the time or ability to clean up\n480+ parks, but like many of you, I know how to throw some code\ntogether. So I decided to build a tool that would connect those\nindividuals with the funds to help to those with the time and physical\nability. This talk is about how I created that tool, which consists of\nREST API, Website, and Android/IOS application using only Python and\nOpen Source technologies. Finally, it is about how all of us as\nprogrammers have the power to make a visibly positive impact in our\ncommunity even from the comfort and familiarity of our keyboards.",
