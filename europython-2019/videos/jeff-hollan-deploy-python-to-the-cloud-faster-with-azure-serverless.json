  "description": "Bringing your Python scripts or apps and running them in the cloud is\neasier than ever with serverless computing. In this talk, we\u2019ll show how\nyou can use Azure Functions to easily deploy and scale your Python\nworkloads without having to manage any servers or pay for unused compute\nresources. We\u2019ll also show how deep integration with Visual Studio Code\noffers a great local development experience with full support for\ndebugging and testing your app, and allows you to seamlessly deploy your\nserverless code to the cloud.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by giving a brief overview of the value of serverless\ncomputing. Next, we'll create a brand new Python app in Visual Studio\nCode, and start to add in business logic and ML capabilities. Once we\nget the app running debugged locally, we\u2019ll publish it to the cloud as a\nserverless function, and demonstrate the serverless scalability.\nFinally, we\u2019ll walk you through the tools and capabilities you can\nleverage around monitoring and management of your Python Azure\nFunctions.",
