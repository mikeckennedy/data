  "description": "Python and R are two of the most popular languages used for data\nanalysis. They are often pitted against each other in pros and cons\nlists, where users feel forced to pick just one. Each has unique\nadvantages, and it's now easier than ever to use them harmoniously.\nPython or R? Why not both?\n\nHow often do you hear the question \"Python or R?\"\n\nAspiring analytics professionals often feel the need to choose & learn a\n'one size fits all' language for their scripting work. There are many\ncases, though, where a specific library in Python or R is more effective\nthan similar libraries in the other language. This can lead to some\npainful tradeoffs when selecting a single language for your work. Great\nnews: recent developments have made leveraging both languages in the\nsame workflow easier than ever before.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll present methods for leveraging R from directly\nwithin Python environments (and vice versa). We will illustrate the use\nof these methods by using popular libraries to execute common analytics\ntasks across languages without switching development environments.\n",
