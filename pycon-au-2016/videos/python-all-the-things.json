  "description": "Russell Keith-Magee\nhttps://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/198/view_talk\nWe\u2019re familiar with Python as a scripting language, as a web server language, as a teaching language, as a data analysis language, and as a teaching language. But is that the limit of where Python can be used? What is the future for Python on other platforms? Is the prospect of using Python on those platforms a novelty, or a viable way to fend off an existential threat to the language? And how does this threat intersect with other threats we have to our community, and to our industry?",
