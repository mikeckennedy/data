  "description": "Decorators are a syntactically-pleasing way of modifying the behavior of\nfunctions in Python. However, they can be highly opaque to Python\nbeginners. It took me a while to learn how to write one, and even after\nI was confident writing my own decorators, felt like they were magical.\nThe goal of this talk is to demystify decorators by methodically\nstepping through how and why they work. Along the way we'll touch on\nclosures, scopes, and how Python is compiled.\n",
