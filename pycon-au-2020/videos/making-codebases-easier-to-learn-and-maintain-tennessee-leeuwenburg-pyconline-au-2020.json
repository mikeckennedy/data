This talk outlines tips and tricks for writing code that is both easier to maintain and easier for other people to learn.\r\n\r\nTopics covered will include:\r\n\r\n- Documentation: both written and in-code\r\n- Structure: how to organise code for readability and easy re-use\r\n- Expression: how to improve comprehensibility of code\r\n- Tests: how to maximise their usefulness\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 14:05:00 2020 at Obvious",
