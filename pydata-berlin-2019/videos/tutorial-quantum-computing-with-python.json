  "description": "Speaker: James Wootton\n\nTrack:PyData\nFrameworks for quantum computing are a new way to use Python for cutting-edge science, and to plan for future applications of this new technology. This session will serve as an introduction to quantum computing as a whole, and also to Qiskit, the most well-developed and well-used quantum Python framework.\r\n\r\nAnd to make sure I don't get too complex, we'll do it all on a microcontroller!\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2019 conference.\nhttps://pycon.de\n\nMore details at the conference page: https://de.pycon.org/program/RE99DB\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pyconde",
