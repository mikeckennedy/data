  "description": "On every computer I've had for the past 20 years, I've created a folder\ncalled \"stupid python tricks\". It's where I put code that should never see\nthe light of day. Code that abuses advanced features like decorators,\nmetaclasses, and dynamic typing to do terrible things. Code I'm going to\nteach you.\n\nI have a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/judy2k/stupid-python-tricks)\nthat contains a compilation of all the awful code I've written over the\nyears, abusing features like metaclasses, decorators, various __dunder__\nmethods, and the mutable nature of Python's underlying data structures.\n\nIt's a funny way to see how Python works under the hood, but it's also\neducational.\n\nReally!\n\nEach of the tricks is entertainingly terrible. But they're also mostly self-\ncontained ways to see what happens when you override certain behaviours of\nthe Python language. Anyone with an intermediate level of Python\nunderstanding should be able to follow along and learn something.",
