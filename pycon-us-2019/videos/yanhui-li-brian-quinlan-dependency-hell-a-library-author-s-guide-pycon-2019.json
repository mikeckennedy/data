  "description": "Python is known for its \"batteries included\" philosophy but no Python\ndeveloper can live without the language's rich library ecosystem.\nUnfortunately, as the number of libraries increases, so does the risk of\ncross-library incompatibilities, or \"dependency hell\".\n\nDependency hell arises when two libraries have mutually conflicting\nrequirements. These can be very difficult for developers to diagnose and\nmay not be fixable without avoiding certain libraries entirely.\n\nAfter this talk, you - the library author - will have a practical set of\nsimple best practices to follow that will allow you to build libraries\nthat are compatible across the Python ecosystem.\n",
