  "description": "Yves Hilpisch (@dyjh)\n\nNot too long ago, the finance field was dominated by compiled languages, such as C or C++, since they were considered to be the right choice for the implementation of computationally demanding algorithms.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Python and its fast growing eco-system of (data analysis) packages have made it today's language of choice for the financial industry.\n\nThis talk illustrates, based on some simple examples, the benefits of working with a high level programming language, such as Python, for the tasks at hand in finance. The examples illustrate that really concise Python code can achieve high performance results.\n\n\n**Recorded at** PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: https://de.pycon.org/\n\n**Video editing**: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\n\n**Tools**: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",
