  "description": "Bokeh is an interactive visualization library that targets modern web\nbrowsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise\nconstruction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js, and to extend this\ncapability with high- performance interactivity over very large or\nstreaming datasets. In this talk, you will learn to use Bokeh to:\n\n-  create simple interactive plots\n-  annotate and styling the plots\n-  using bokeh plots in web pages\n-  link interactive visualizations to a running python instance\n-  stream data to plots\n-  using Datashader to view and interact with large datasets\n\nData visualization is key to understanding the information contained in\ndata. The interactivity provide a valuable means for engineers, data\njournalist, and scientist to explore their data. This talk will\nintroduce ( *using also some code example* ) the audience to the basics\nof using Bokeh, demonstrate different aspects of the library, and teach\nhow to deal with data formats ( *pandas* , *numpy* , *bokeh Column Data\nSource* )\n\nKnowledge required: ``python3``, ``pandas basics``, ``numpy bascis``,\n``data mining``, ``jupyter notebook``\n\nFor some visualization examples refers\n`here <https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html#gallery>`__\n\nin \\_\\_on **sabato 21 aprile** at 12:45 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
