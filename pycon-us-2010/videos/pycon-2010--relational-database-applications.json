  "description": "Turbogears Database Applications (Relational Database Applications)\n\nPresented by Chris Perkins\n\nTurboGears2 provides a rich toolset to provide developers with a\nplatform for developing web applications with existing databases. This\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153un-tutorial\u00e2\u20ac\u009d has a simple goal. The participants may bring in their\nown databases, and we will explore how TurboGears can use this database\nto create a working web application. If the student does not want to use\nher own database, one will be provided. This tutorial will focus on the\nTurboGears Admin system, along with relational databases.\n\nThis tutorial is intended to be an un-tutorial. The idea is simple.\nBring a public database, (or 4) and share with the class as we explore\nthe new admin- level RESTful features that TurboGears2 employs.\n\nAt the end of the class, the goal is for everyone to have a working TG2\napplication, with a working admin, at least one customized form or\ntable, based on a database they, or another student brought to class.\n\nRequirements\n\nLaptop with Python 2.5 or 2.6 installed. Database system of your choice\n(Postgres, Sqlite, MySQL) Python drivers for your desired database\nsystem installed. (psychopg2, pg8000, pysqlite, mysql-python)\n",
