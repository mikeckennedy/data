  "description": "Django is a high-level Python based web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.\nDjango comes with it's very own templating layer, which is not merely python embedded into HTML, but it is a dumb python-like DSL which, by design, keeps programming logic out of the templates and keeps the presentation layer clean.\nIn this talk we will introduce ourselves to the Django Template Language and cover most of the useful tags and filters. We will also look into how to write custom tags and filters.",
