  "description": "If you\u2019re a beginner about to embark on a new Django project adventure, this talk is for you.\n\nWhen I started my first Django project, I took the \u201cSure, I think I can figure that out\u201d approach, which is fun! And also dangerous. But exciting! And also horrible because I caused myself a lot of trouble and barfed on my keyboard. (Metaphorically.) Oops.\n\nMy hope for this talk is to pass along lessons I learned the hard way, and save the world. Or at least prevent some frustration. :)\n\nWe\u2019ll talk about:\n\n- version control\n- structuring your project\n- and how to handle top secret stuff.\n\nWe\u2019ll also talk about:\n\n- throwing house parties without causing anaphylaxis\n- pregnant daddy seahorses\n- velociraptors\n- and friends.\n\nI promise all of that is related to Django.",
