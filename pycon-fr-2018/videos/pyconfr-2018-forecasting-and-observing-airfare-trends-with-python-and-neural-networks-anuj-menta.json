  "description": "We have always been taught that the earlier you book a flight, the\ncheaper it is. What if I said it isn't? You see it's not a straight line\nand it has a minimum at some point (someday before the flight). We are\ngoing to see how historical Airfare data can help us derive the best day\nto book a flight so that you 'actually' get the cheapest fares.\n\nThe talk would talk about the entire process, from getting the data, to\ntraining a basic Neural network on the data. With advancements in deep\nlearning in these few years, it is very easy to train a simple\nstatistical model to predict the prices.\n",
