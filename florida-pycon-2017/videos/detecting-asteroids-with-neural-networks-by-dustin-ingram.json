  "description": "TensorFlow is an open-source software library for Machine Intelligence.\nIn this talk, we will learn how to use it to build and train a neural\nnetwork with the goal of correctly identifying asteroids in\nastrophotography data. The dataset used will be from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey, one of the most ambitious and influential surveys in the\nhistory of astronomy.\n\nUsing this data, we will learn how to create and featurize a training\ndataset, build and fit a neural network, and train our model to\ncorrectly identify asteroids visible from Earth.\n\nThis talk is for a wide range of Python developers, from those who have\nheard of machine learning, but have never experimented with it, to those\nwho have significant experience with neural networks, but have never\nused TensorFlow before.\n\nThe audience should have some basic Python knowledge, but no formal or\ninformal experience with machine intelligence is assumed.\n\nAfter watching this talk, the audience should know how to determine and\ndevelop features, how and why to build a training dataset, how to build\nand train a neural network, and some other approaches to supervised\nlearning.",
