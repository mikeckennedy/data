  "abstract": "The explosion in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is\nunprecedented now - and text analysis is likely the most easily\naccessible and understandable part of this. And with python, it is crazy\neasy to do this - python has been used as a parsing langauge forever,\nand with the rich set of Natural Language Processing and Computational\nLinguistic tools, it's worth doing text analysis even if you don't want\nto.\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to convince the python community to do text\nanalysis - and explain both the hows and the whys. Python has\ntraditionally been a very good parsing language, aruguably replacing\nperl for all text file handling tasks. Reading files, regular\nexpressions, writring to files, crawling on the web for textual data\nhave all been standard ways to use python - and now with the Machine\nLearning and AI explosion - we have a great set of tools in python to\nunderstand all the textual data we can so easily play with.\n\nI will be briefly talking aboubt the merits, de-merits and use-cases of\nthe most popular text processing libraries. In particular, these will be\nspaCy, NLTK, gensim. I will also talk about how to use traditional\nMachine Learning libraries for text analysis, such as scikit-learn,\nKeras and TensorFlow. Pre- processing is the one of the most important\nsteps of Text Analysis, and I will talk more about this - after all,\ngarbage in, garbage out!\n\nThe final part of the talk will be about where to get your data - and\nhow to create your own textual data as well. You could analyse anything,\nfrom your own emails and whatsapp conversations to freely available\nBritish Parliament transcripts!\n",
