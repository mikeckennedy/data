  "description": "ZimboPy is an organic, on-the-ground effort by a local non-profit\norganization and Python developers in the Harare software development\ncommunity to advance the cause of women in technology in Zimbabwe. The\nprogram operates in community centers, universities, high schools and\ntech hubs to make programming accessible to girls regardless of their\nsocio-economic status. Upon initially joining a ZimboPy club, many of\nthe girls would have never used a computer before, let alone code.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, only 17% of computer science undergraduate majors are\nwomen, and in the developing world, women make up less than 20% of the\ninformation and technology workforce. ZimboPy exists to empower\nZimbabwean girls with the skills and confidence necessary to not only\nenter the local tech industry, but to lead it.\n\nIn addition to learning to code, ZimboPy club members also join a global\nnetwork of women in technology that are working to tackle social\nchallenges through human-centered design and computer science. ZimboPy\u2019s\nmentorship program invites experienced women developers, mainly from the\nUnited States and Europe, to help Zimbabwean girls address local\nproblems which can be solved with technology, such as clean water and\ne-commerce solutions for small shops in towns and villages. Mentors will\ntravel to Zimbabwe and work with girls as they develop a plan for their\napplications and pair-program with them, answering questions and\nproviding feedback along the way. To ensure that the girls are\nsuccessful, mentors will continue to work with their groups even after\nleaving the country through weekly video conferences and email feedback.\nOverall, ZimboPy looks forward to changing Zimbabwe\u2019s future through\ncreativity, collaboration and the power of Python programming.\n",
