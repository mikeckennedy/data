  "summary": "Writing software in an organisation or for ourselves, many people feel\nthat they \"should\" somehow be doing Test Driven Development (TDD)\nbecause \"everybody else\" is and it's cool, somewhere between necessary\nand useful and they heard testing was good. When informed that must of\nTDD isn't about testing (despite the name!), confusion reigns. Behaviour\nDriven Development is a different way of approaching the \"how to\nvalidate your code\" problem.\n",
