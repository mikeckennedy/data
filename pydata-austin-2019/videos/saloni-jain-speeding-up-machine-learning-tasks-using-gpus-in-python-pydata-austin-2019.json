  "description": "GPUs are typically used to accelerate deep learning models, but they haven't been widely deployed for traditional machine learning. This talk will cover cuML's GPU based implementation of Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms, aimed to provide 10x-50x speedup and a new library called Forest Inference Library (FIL), which allows GPU accelerated inference of different pretrained forest models",
