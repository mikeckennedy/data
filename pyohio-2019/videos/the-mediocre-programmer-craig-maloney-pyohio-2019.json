  "description": "Mediocre Programmers? What is that? Shouldn't we want to be great\nprogrammers instead? In this talk we'll discuss what it means to be a\nmediocre programmer. We'll consider the many pitfalls that may befall\nyou on your journey, from self-doubt to burnout, and share tips for how\nto cope with the challenges of programming and when it might be time to\ntry something new.\n\nThis talk is highlights from a book that I'm writing about the journey\nof being a mediocre programmer. Beginners tend to get all of the love,\nand advanced programmers get all of the respect and glory. But we don't\nhave much for helping intermediate programmers. We don't tend to\nconsider how difficult it can be to work through the exuberance of\nbeginning programming (where everything is new, fresh, and exciting)\ninto becoming better programmers. We're just expected to figure things\nout on our own. This talk draws on my experiences of being a mediocre\nprogrammer and gives advice and tips on how to become better\nprogrammers. We'll cover how to find a group of traveling companions,\nhow to focus on learning one thing at a time, and how to deal with the\nstruggles of our emotions and self doubt. We'll also cover examining our\nemotions and understanding when the spark that drew us to programming is\ntruly burned out.\n",
