  "summary": "Python generators have long been useful for solving all sorts of\nproblems involving iteration and data flow. However, one of their more\npowerful uses is in customizing various aspects of program control flow.\nIn this tutorial, we'll look at some more exotic uses of generators such\nas writing context managers, inlining callback functions, eliminating\nrecursion, implementing actors, and more.\n",
