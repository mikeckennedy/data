  "description": "NumPy is the most fundamental package for scientific computing with\nPython. It adds to the Python language a data structure (the NumPy\narray) that has access to a large library of mathematical functions and\noperations, providing a powerful framework for fast computations in\nmultiple dimensions. NumPy is the basis for all SciPy packages which\nextends vastly the computational and algorithmic capabilities of Python\nas well as many visualization tools like Matplotlib, Chaco or Mayavi.\n\nThis tutorial will teach students the fundamentals of NumPy, including\nfast vector-based calculations on numpy arrays, the origin of its\nefficiency and a short introduction to the matplotlib plotting library.\nIn the final section, more advanced concepts will be introduced\nincluding structured arrays, broadcasting and memory mapping.\n",
