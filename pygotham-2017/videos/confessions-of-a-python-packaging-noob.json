  "description": "When my source code repo become too large, I decided to split some modules out into a separate package, which can be installed from GitHub or other repositories using pip. Along the way, I learned about:\n\n- The difference between a package and a module\n- Setuptools\n- The setup.py file\n- Using a requirements.txt file in a package\n- Recommended directory structure for a package\n- Package versioning\n- PyPI, the Python Package Index\n- Labeling a package version on GitHub\n- Using pip to install a package from GitHub\n\n\nI\u2019ll share my packaging journey and provide links to helpful documentation. This talk is suitable for a moderately technical audience. Programmers and non-programmers alike will gain a greater understanding of Python packaging.",
