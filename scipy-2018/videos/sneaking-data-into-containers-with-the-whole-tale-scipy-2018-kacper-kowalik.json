  "description": "Accessing remote data with persistent, user-definable computational\nenvironments is a key challenge in digital scholarship. The Whole Tale\nis a response to this requirement, building and combining components to\nprovide a virtual research \"home\" on the web. In this talk, we'll\ndescribe how the Whole Tale project leverages existing Python projects\n(Jupyter, PyFilesystem, fusepy, WsgiDAV, Girder and many others) to\nbring remote analysis (including code and environment) and data\ntogether, providing persistent workspaces while automatically capturing\nprovenance and data lineage to facilitate reproducibility and\nverifiability -- cornerstones of the scholarly process.Presenter(s):\nSpeaker: Matthew Turk, University of Illinois Speaker: Kacper Kowalik,\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n",
