  "description": "The humble loop: it's hard to write a program without it. Whether it's\nprocessing numbers in a sequence, lines in a text file, users in a\ndatabase, or any other list of things, you use loops all the time. But\ndid you know that Python has a lot of different ways to write loops?\nReaching for the right looping tool can make your code cleaner, more\nreadable, easier to test, and it can even make it run faster! By the end\nof this talk, you'll be looping like a pro, and your code will be better\nfor it.\n",
