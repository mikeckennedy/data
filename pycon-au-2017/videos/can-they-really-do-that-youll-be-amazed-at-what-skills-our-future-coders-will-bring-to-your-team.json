Finally, we will see future coders enter the industry with a defined set of skills and attitudes. Exactly what skills are they bringing with them? What skills will they have tucked in their backpacks when they join your workplaces? \n\nJoin me as I walk you through the learning journey of our future coders and digital disruptors as they traverse the new learning curve thrust upon them in their years at school and the impact this will have on your own teams and work environments.",
