  "description": "Jedi is an autocompletion library for Python that has gained quite a\nfollowing over the last year. There are a couple of plugins for the most\npopular editors (VIM, Sublime, Emacs, etc.) and mainstream IDEs like\nSpyder are switching to Jedi.\n\nJedi basically tries to redefine the boundaries of autocompletion in\ndynamic languages. Most people still think that there's no hope for\ndecent autocompletion in Python. This talk will try to argue the\nopposite, that decent autocompletion is very close.\n\nWhile the first part will be about Jedi, the second part of this talk\nwill discuss the future of dynamic analysis. Dynamic Analysis is what I\ncall the parts that static analysis doesn't cover. The hope is to\ngenerate a kind of \"compiler\" that doesn't execute code but reports\nadditional bugs in your code (AttributeErrors and the like).\n\nI still have to work out the details of the presentation. I also have to\nadd that Jedi I'm currently working full-time on Jedi and that there's\ngoing to be some major improvements until the conference. Autocompletion\nand static/dynamic analysis as well as refactoring are hugely important\ntools for a dynamic language IMHO, because they can improve the only big\ndisadvantage compared to static languages: Finding bugs before running\nyour tool.\n",

  "summary": "Finding bugs before runtime has been an incredibly tedious task in\nPython. Jedi is an autocompletion library with interesting capabilities:\nIt understands a lot of the dynamic features of Python. I will show you\nhow we can use the force of (the) Jedi to identify bugs in your Python\ncode. It's not just another pylint. It's way better.\n",
