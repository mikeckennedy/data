  "description": "Django needs you! No -- seriously -- Django is a volunteer project, and\nthe ability of Django to continue to improve is entirely controlled by\nthe time and dedication people like you are willing to put into making\nDjango better.\n\nHowever, it's not just a matter of sitting down and writing code. If you\ndon't have a plan for how you're going to engage with the rest of the\ncommunity, it's very easy to put in a lot of effort, and then have that\neffort go entirely to waste. This talk will give you some tips on how to\nengage the community so that you can see your effort turn into progress,\nand not just be lost in a mailing list.\n\nGetting involved doesn't just mean contributing code, either. There are\nlots of other ways that you can be a valuable member of the community,\nand this talk will give you several suggestions for how your talents\ncould be used to improve the entire Django ecosystem.\n",

We have a huge user\ncommunity, but the vast majority of users never make the leap and become\ncontributors. This talk will walk you through the process of making the\ntransition from Django user, to Django Project contributor.\n",
