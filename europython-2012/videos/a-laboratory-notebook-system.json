  "description": "Many scientists are using a laboratory notebook when conducting\nexperiments. The scientist documents each step, either taken in the\nexperiment or afterwards when processing data. Due to computerized\nresearch systems, acquired data increases in volume and becomes more\nelaborate. This increases the need to migrate from originally\npaper-based to electronic notebooks with data storage, computational\nfeatures and reliable electronic documentation. This talks describes a\nlaboratory notebook based on the Python data management software\nDataFinder. It allows to manage data from experiments and simulations,\nto run analysis software and to create visualizations of results. The\nlaboratory notebook assures that the complete history of all performed\nsteps (\"Provenance\") is recorded, that results can be signed digitally,\nand that results can be archived in a secure archive to avoid and\nprevent legal issues.\n",
