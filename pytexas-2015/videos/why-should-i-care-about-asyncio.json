  "description": "Python 3.3 added ``yield from`` and 3.4 added\n```asyncio`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`__. Python\n3.5 adds ``async`` and ``await`` from `PEP\n492 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/>`__. What is all this\nstuff? Why do we need new syntax? And why should I care?\n\nThis talk is about why async programming is worth caring about and why\nPython's approach has me so excited.\n",
