  "description": "Python is a flexible language. Your Python app, on the other hand, is\nusually more set in stone: buttons, functions, displays are all\nexplicitly defined.\n\nIn this talk you'll learn how to take advantage of features like\ndecorators and functions as first-class objects to set up a simple\nplugin system that allows your app to be more flexible. In fact, you can\nallow your users to add or customize functionality they want after you\nship.\n\nBy using plugins, your code becomes more modular and maintainable. At\nthe same time your users may be able to use your great app to work with\ndata or challenges you didn't even know existed.\n",
