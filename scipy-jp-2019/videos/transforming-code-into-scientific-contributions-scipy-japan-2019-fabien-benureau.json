  "description": "Throughout the evolution of a small random walk example implemented in Python, we'll illustrate some of the issues that may plague scientific code. The code may be correct and of good quality, but still many problems may reduce its contribution to scientific knowledge. To make these problems explicit, we'll articulate five characteristics that a code should possess to be a useful part of a scientific publication: it should be re-runnable, repeatable, reproducible, reusable and replicable.\n\u200b\n\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",
