  "description": "ML? API? AutoML? Python is the language of choice to solve problems with machine learning, but what can we build in only a few hours or days and without any expertise? In this session, we'll see how to benefit from existing ML models and how to create a custom model with AutoML techniques. We\u2019ll also be active players of a live demo, so don't put your smartphone on airplane mode!",
