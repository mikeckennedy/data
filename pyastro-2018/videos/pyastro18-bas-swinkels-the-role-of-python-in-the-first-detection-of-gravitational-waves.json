  "description": "The last 2 years saw the spectacular birth of Gravitational Wave astronomy, which featured the first ever detection of signals generated by colliding black holes, and a neutron star merger of which the afterglow has been observed across the EM spectrum. I will give a quick overview of the recent discoveries, and then explain how Python plays a key role in this field. I will focus on the automation of the Virgo interferometer and on analysis tools used for understanding the disturbances that are limiting the sensitivity of these complex instruments.\n",
