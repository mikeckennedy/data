  "description": "Machine learning plays an important role in cancer research. In this talk, we\u2019ll tackle the challenge of predicting which patients are likely to respond to given anti-cancer treatments. In doing so, we\u2019ll show how tools such as Snakemake/Bioconda can be used to create reproducible workflows and illustrate the challenges of interpreting predictive models in large, highly-correlated feature spaces.",
