  "description": "MariaDB 10.2 is the current stable release, and MariaDB 10.3 the\ncurrent development release. This talk introduces some of the new\nfeatures that may be of interest to Python developers, in particular\nWindow Functions and Common Table Expressions (CTEs). Window\nfunctions are similar to aggregate functions in that they perform\ncalculations across a set of rows. Recursive CTEs are excellent for\nnavigating a tree structure, or a route map, which regular SQL is\npoor at.\n\nBy making use of these features. more work can be passed on to the\ndatabase layer, simplifying the code and improving performance.\n",
