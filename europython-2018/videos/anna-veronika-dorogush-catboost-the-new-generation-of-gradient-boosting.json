  "description": "Gradient boosting is a powerful machine-learning technique that achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in a variety of practical tasks. For a number\nof years, it has remained the primary method for learning problems with\nheterogeneous features, noisy data, and complex dependencies: web\nsearch, recommendation systems, weather forecasting, and many others.\nCatBoost (http://catboost.yandex) is a new open-source gradient boosting\nlibrary, that outperforms existing publicly available implementations of\ngradient boosting in terms of quality. It has a set of addional\nadvantages.\n\n1. CatBoost is able to incorporate categorical features in your data\n   (like music genre, URL, search query, etc.) in predictive models with\n   no additional preprocessing. For more details on our approach please\n   refer to our NIPS 2017 ML Systems Workshop paper\n   (http://learningsys.org/nips17/assets/papers/paper\\_11.pdf).\n\n2. CatBoost inference is 20-60 times faster then in other open-source\n   gradient boosting libraries, which makes it possible to use CatBoost\n   for latency-critical tasks.\n\n3. CatBoost has the fastest GPU and multi GPU training implementations\n   of all the openly available gradient boosting libraries.\n\n4. CatBoost requires no hyperparameter tunning in order to get a model\n   with good quality.\n\n5. CatBoost is highly scalable and can be efficiently trained using\n   hundreds of machines\n\nThe talk will cover a broad description of gradient boosting and its\nareas of usage and the differences between CatBoost and other gradient\nboosting libraries. We will also briefly explain the details of the\nproprietary algorithm that leads to a boost in quality.\n",
