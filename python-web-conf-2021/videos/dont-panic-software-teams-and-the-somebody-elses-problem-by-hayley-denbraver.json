  "description": "\"Don\u2019t Panic: Software Teams and the 'Somebody Else\u2019s Problem'\" by: Hayley Denbraver\n\nOf all the strange things in the galaxy, the SEP Field might be the strangest. A Somebody Else\u2019s Problem field renders something not invisible, but unnoticed. An SEP field relies on people\u2019s natural disposition not to see anything they don\u2019t want to, weren\u2019t expecting, or can\u2019t explain.\n\nWhere might SEP fields be in your software? Where are they in your teams? What intergalactic threat is waiting for you, out in the open but entirely ignored?\n\nFirst, don\u2019t panic. Second, make sure you have your towel. Third, forgive the speaker for her Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy jokes. Finally, confront the problems in front of you. All 42 of them.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
