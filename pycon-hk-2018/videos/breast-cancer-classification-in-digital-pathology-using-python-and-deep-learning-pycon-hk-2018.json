  "description": "Breast cancer is one of the leading cancer-related death causes\nworldwide, specially for women. In this talk, we will talk about how\nDeep Learning & Python could help pathologists to classify breast cancer\nmicroscopic images. The speaker will share his approach that won the\n\u201c\\ `ICIAR 2018 Grand Challenge on Breast Cancer Histology\nimages <https://iciar2018-challenge.grand-challenge.org/Legacy-results/>`__\\ \u201d,\nwhich was implemented in Python.\n\nRefer to the papers for more details:\n\n-  https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04277\n-  https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-93000-8_106\n\n",
