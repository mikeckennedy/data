  "description": "COVID has changed the landscape of in-person events, resulting in cancelled meetups, conferences, and workshops all over the world. Despite the cancellations, the Python community has continued to meet, grow, and learn together.\r\n\r\nJoin this interactive session to learn from community organizers based in three counties: Zimbabwe, Indonesia, and South Korea to hear about how COVID has impacted their communities, and what they\u2019ve done to continue to foster a local Python community in spite of quarantines and cancellations.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycascades-2021/talk/SYDH97/\n\nAfter three amazing in-person conferences, this time we're moving PyCascades online.\r\n\r\nPyCascades is a regional PyCon in the Pacific Northwest, celebrating the west coast Python developer and user community. Our organizing team includes members of the Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland Python user groups.\r\n\r\nVideos are released as CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#pycascades #pycon #python #conference\n\nSat Feb 20 13:55:00 2021 at Interactive Track",
