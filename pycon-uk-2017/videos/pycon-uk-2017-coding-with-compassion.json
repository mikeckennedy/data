  "description": "**Apologies for the slides being slightly cut off, the camera was recording unattended and it got knocked just before the presentation started**\n\nWhat does it mean to be compassionate, and how does it differ from sympathy and empathy? What does compassion look like in action when working as a software developer? This talk will highlight some of the main tenets of compassionate behavior and what advantages they bring when working with other people. Additionally, a closer look into emotional intelligence will reveal how it can be developed and leveraged to improve communication and productivity within cross-functional teams. Practical propositions will also be suggested on how we as developers can exercise our most compassionate selves when working with business colleagues and fellow developers. And of equal importance, we will look at what it means to be compassionate towards oneself.",
