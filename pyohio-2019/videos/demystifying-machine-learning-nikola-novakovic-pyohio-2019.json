  "description": "Machine Learning is something you'll see referenced very frequently now\nin everything from marketing materials to sales pitches, and job\npostings. With so much hype it can be hard to distinguish what people\nmean when they say Machine Learning. In this talk we will demystify\nMachine Learning by understanding its core concepts and applying that\nknowledge to real world examples.\n\nWe\u2019ll explain basic concepts like linear algebra and loss functions,\nfigure out when to use machine learning and build an ML model that we\u2019ll\nbe able to use in real world apps. Here\u2019s an in-depth list of what we\u2019ll\ncover:\n\n-  What Machine Learning is and where it\u2019s being used\n-  How to recognize when machine learning is necessary\n-  Math & Statistics 101\n-  Algorithm 1: Linear Regression\n-  Live Coding Session Salary Estimator\n-  Q & A\n",
