  "description": "Python is widely used as both a professional software engineering language,\nand as a \"learning\" language that many programmers get started with. But in the\nearly days of computing there was BASIC, the Beginners All-purpose Symbolic\nInstruction Code. BASIC's original developers, Kemeny and Kurtz at Dartmouth\nUniversity, created it as a language that all students, from every field could\nuse, and that led to its widespread adoption. It quickly become the de facto\nhome computer language, and was pre-installed on virtually all computers right\nup through the year 2000.\n\nWe'll review the syntax similarities and differences between Python and BASIC,\ncompare the source code and execution of several identical programs written in\nboth languages, and discuss the implementation of their respective \"compilers\".\nMaybe BASIC can still teach us, and future language designers, some lessons?\n",
