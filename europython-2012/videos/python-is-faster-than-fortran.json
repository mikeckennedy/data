  "description": "Many people may think that Python is slow because it is compiled to byte\ncode. This presentation shows that Python can be fast even for\ncomputational intensive applications. In the example presented here,\nPython competes with FORTRAN, a programming languages renowned for its\nperformance and aggressively optimizing compilers. Python offers\npowerful data structures such as sets that make writing efficient\nalgorithms extremely simple. FORTRAN on the other hand, has much less in\nsuch support. For the given example, it takes considerably more\nprogramming in FORTRAN than in Python to achieve similar execution times\nfor large data sizes. The comparison of program run times and lines of\ncode, which can be roughly translated into development effort, shows\nthat Python can actually be faster than FORTRAN under many circumstances\ntypically found in real life.\n",
