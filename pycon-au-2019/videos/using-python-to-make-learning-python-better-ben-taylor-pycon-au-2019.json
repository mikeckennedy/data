  "description": "As programmers one of the biggest super-powers we have is to improve the world by making new tools, automating work and making the tedious easy. As educators we know that things like personalised learning, scaffolding, and feedback really help our students. But doing all that can be challenging! We don\u2019t have the tools, and it\u2019s really tedious. Hang on!? Isn\u2019t that our super-power?\n\nIn this talk I\u2019ll explore how we can use our super-powers as programmers (and as educators) to improve our own practice. I\u2019ll talk about how we can help develop deeper understanding in our students, and use tools (that we build) to do it! Programming isn\u2019t just for \u201capp developers\u201d it\u2019s something that everyone can use, so let\u2019s demonstrate that by using it ourselves.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/using-python-to-make-learning-python-better\n\nFri Aug  2 09:15:00 2019 at C3.4 & C3.5",
