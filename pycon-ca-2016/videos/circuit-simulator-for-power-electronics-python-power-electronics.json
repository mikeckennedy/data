  "description": "Simulating large systems with multiple power electronic converters is a\nchallenge due to the non-linear nature of the circuit and the necessity\nto model the associated control systems with each converter. Python\nPower Electronics aims to provide a free and open source solution that\ncan be used by both academics and industry professionals.\n\nShivkumar V. Iyer Bio\n---------------------\n\nI am a Power Electronics Engineer at a start-up in Kingston, ON that\ndevelops solar microinverters. As a power electronics engineer my\nprimary interest is in simulating large electrical systems with multiple\npower electronic converters. For this purpose, I am developing my own\nfree and open source circuit simulator called Python Power Electronics\n(http://www.pythonpowerelectronics.com/). This circuit simulator has\nbeen developed purely in Python and began with a blog\n(http://pythonpowerelectronics.blogspot.ca/) and a project hosting on\nSourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pythonpowerelec/). The\nwebsite (http://www.pythonpowerelectronics.com/) now contains all parts\nof the project including case studies and examples and also\ndocumentation on how to use the software. My primary interest lies in\nsimulating power systems with renewable energy systems.\n",
