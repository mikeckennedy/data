  "description": "This tutorial is an introduction to geospatial data analysis in Python,\nwith a focus on tabular vector data. It is the first part in a series of\ntwo tutorials; this part focuses on introducing the participants to the\ndifferent libraries to work with geospatial data and will cover munging\ngeo-data and exploring relations over space. This includes importing\ndata in different formats (e.g. shapefile, GeoJSON), visualizing,\ncombining and tidying them up for analysis, and will use libraries such\nas ``pandas``, ``geopandas``, ``shapely``, ``PySAL``, or ``rasterio``.\nThe second part will built upon this and focus on more more advanced\ngeographic data science and statistical methods to gain insight from the\ndata. No previous experience with those geospatial python libraries is\nneeded, but basic familiarity with geospatial data and concepts\n(shapefiles, vector vs raster data) and pandas will be\nhelpful.Presenter(s): Speaker: Serge Rey, University of California,\nRiverside Speaker: Dani Arribas- Bel, University of Liverpool Speaker:\nJoris Van den Bossche, Universit\u00e9 Paris- Saclay Center for Data Science\nSpeaker: Levi Wolf, University of Bristol\n",
