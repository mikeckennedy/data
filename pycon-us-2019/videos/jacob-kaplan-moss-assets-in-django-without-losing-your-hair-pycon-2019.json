  "description": "There's one part of building a Django app I hate: setting up handling of\nassets and media. There are so many moving pieces \u2014 static assets, asset\ncompilation and compression, file uploads, storage engines, etc. etc. I\ncan never remember how it all fits together. I wrote this talk for one\nvery selfish reason: to document how this all works, in one place, once\nand for all.\n\nThis talk is primarily intended for Django developers who want to build\nan asset pipeline that Just Works. The bulk of the talk covers front-end\ntooling (Webpack, PostCSS, Babel, etc.), so full-stack developers of any\nstripe will find something here, too.\n",
