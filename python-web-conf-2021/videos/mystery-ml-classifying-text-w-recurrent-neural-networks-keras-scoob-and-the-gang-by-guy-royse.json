  "description": "\"Mystery Machine Learning: Classifying Text with Recurrent Neural Networks, Keras, and Scoob and the Gang\" by: Guy Royse\n\nJinkies! Spoiler Alert! If you\u2019ve seen Scooby-Doo, you know who the monster always is\u2014Old Man Withers, the guy who runs the amusement park. Amusement park operators like Old Man Withers have caused Mystery, Inc. all sorts of problems over the years. Problems that could be avoided with a properly trained recurrent neural network. With RNNs, Scoob and the Gang could have built a model to classify everyone\u2019s speech. This would show them that Old Man Withers and Redbeard\u2019s Ghost sounded a lot alike!\n\nWe can help Mystery, Inc. with this problem by building a recurrent neural network to do just that. You know we got a mystery to solve, and we\u2019re going to solve it by building our model using lines from Scooby-Doo, Keras, and TensorFlow. Once we have our model, we\u2019ll host it on RedisAI so we can quickly build an application to make use of it. Well, we\u2019ve got some work to do now.\n\nI will also explain what neural networks are in general, what recurrent neural networks are in particular, and discuss some practical use of this technology. When we\u2019re done, you\u2019ll know how to build RNNs with Keras, use them to classify text, and integrate them into your application. But more importantly, you\u2019re going to have yourself a Scooby snack! That\u2019s a fact!\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
