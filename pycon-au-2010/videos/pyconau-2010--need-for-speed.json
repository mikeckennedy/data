  "description": "Need for Speed\n\nPresented by Dr. Graeme Cross\n\n\"Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess\nand put in a speed hack until you have proven that's where the\nbottleneck is.\" (Rob Pike)\n\nPython is a great balance of productivity, expressiveness and\nperformance, but there are times when it would nice to have a Python\napplication run faster. This is particularly true for large scale data\nprocessing, numerical work, controlling real world devices, and\nanimation.\n\nUsing some real-world examples, this talk covers tools and techniques\nthat allow you to systematically understand where the bottlenecks are in\nyour code and then how to effectively optimise your code, without having\nto resort to writing modules in C/C++.\n",
