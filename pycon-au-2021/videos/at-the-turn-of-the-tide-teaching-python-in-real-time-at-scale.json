  "description": "(Stephen Tierney, Alison Wong) Teaching a programming language can be challenging, even more so when your classroom is suddenly virtual and you have to teach 1200 students. With some clever thinking our multidisciplinary teaching team turned this crisis to our advantage and achieved an all time high level of student satisfaction. We are now able to reach any student, no matter their location, timezone or computing device with a real-time collaborative coding environment.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover what we consider \u201cmust-haves\u201d for teaching in these extreme circumstances and how we have been able to maintain student engagement. We will demonstrate our solution to hosting tutorials online and share the lessons we learnt along the way.\n\nhttps://2021.pycon.org.au/program/RWKZXE/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country\u2019s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 13:30:00 2021 at Education",
