  "abstract": "Multi-touch attribution is a popular marketing science challenge. This\nis a tricky problem to solve as the goal label we need to train for is a\nlatent variable i.e. can\u2019t be directly observed in the real world. The\ne-commerce industry is actively looking at using fancy ML techniques to\ndesign a solution.\n\nHowever, the question still remains, how do we know which methodology is\nthe best for Multi-touch Attribution?\n\n`At Skyscanner, we have explored this problem space\nfurther <https://medium.com/@SkyscannerEng/lets-make-roi-a-fair-%20game-e2eb734a9560>`__.\nWe use a *simulated marketing environment* to benchmark different\nmethodologies. In this talk I will discuss:\n\n-  Benefits of benchmarking in a simulated environment.\n-  How to build your own simulated environment.\n-  Stress testing the solution with alternative scenarios.\n\nAn overview of this talk can be seen in `this\nblog <http://bit.ly/Multi-%20TouchAttribution>`__ and `this research\nposter <http://bit.ly/MTA-Poster>`__\n",
