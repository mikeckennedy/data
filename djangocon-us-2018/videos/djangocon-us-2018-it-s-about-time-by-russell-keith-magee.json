  "description": "Here\u2019s a fun experiment: Mention timezones within earshot of any\nexperienced programmer. Now wait until the profanity stops.\n\nHandling dates and time is an incredibly common requirement in computer\napplications. That\u2019s hardly surprising - we all use computers to record\nwhen we did old things, track how long things take, and to plan when\nwe\u2019re going to do things. So why is dealing with time so difficult?\n\nWell, it\u2019s because time has a very sordid history. What we even think of\n*as* time has changed. In this talk, you\u2019ll travel through time, and see\nthe impact that two thousand years of history have had on our modern\nlife. You\u2019ll be shown how all this wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey history\nstuff affects the data modelling and APIs we use on a daily basis.\n\nThis is going to take some\u2026 time.\n",
