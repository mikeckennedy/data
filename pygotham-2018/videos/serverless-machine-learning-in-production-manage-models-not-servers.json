  "description": "Putting machine learning models into production is difficult. It\u2019s especially hard to do for a team that isn\u2019t cross-function and doesn\u2019t have strong ops or software engineering support. At Distil we used severless technology to deploy a Python-based machine learning system that let data scientists rapidly put models they trained into production for detecting automated threats on websites. This talk will discuss how we rapidly built this pipeline, what we learned and what we\u2019d do differently in the future. We make hundreds of predictions per second and stream the results to hundreds of machines all without having to manage any machines or hardware.",
