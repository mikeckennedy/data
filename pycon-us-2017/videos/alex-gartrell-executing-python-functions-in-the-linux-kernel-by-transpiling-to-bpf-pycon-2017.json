  "description": "``ebpf`` is a linux kernel byte-code which can be used for functionality\nranging from tracing system calls with kprobe to routing packets with\ntc. This talk is about a pure-python front-end for ebpf that allows\nusers to write simple python functions to be executed in the kernel.\nI'll first explain how this was made to work and then I'll show off some\nof the features/capabilities of this approach with working examples.\n",
