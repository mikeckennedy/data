  "description": "Powering a website with services and microservices has both benefits and challenges; learn about both as we look at the challenges of porting code from a monolith to run as individual services, and the variety of ways you can structure services and communication.\n\nWe'll also take a detailed look at using the underlying components of Channels (ASGI) for service transport, and how the tradeoffs it's built upon affect service architecture and deployment, including real world examples and experiences.",
