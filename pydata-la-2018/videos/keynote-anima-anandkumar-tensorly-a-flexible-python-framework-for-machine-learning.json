  "abstract": "TensorLy is a python library that provides a high level API for tensor\nmethods and deep tensorized architectures. Tensor methods are natural\nextensions of traditional matrix algebraic methods to higher orders.\nWhile they have been extensively used in fields such as quantum systems,\nsignal processing and psychometrics, they only recently started to be\nemployed in Machine Learning. They have the potential to both help us\ndevelop better theory about deep learning, and to leverage the\nmulti-dimensional structure in the data. After a short introduction to\ntensor methods, I will present some way in which tensor methods can be\ncombined with deep learning, and demonstrate through Jupyter notebooks\non how easy it is specify tensorized neural networks.\n",
