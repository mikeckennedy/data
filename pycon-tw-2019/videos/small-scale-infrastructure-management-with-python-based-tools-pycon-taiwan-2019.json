  "description": "Day 1, R1 13:00\u201313:45\n\nManaging server infrastructures (i.e. everything below the application stack) is a lot of work. There is hardware to install, operating systems to set up, IP addresses to assign and backup the manage; at the same time, there are more to manage as the business grows. This talk will present several Python-based tools (namely cloud-init, curtin, MAAS, and Ansible) can help manage the infrastructure (even if the fleet is too small to justify huge investment in automation), and take a look at how they work under the hood.\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\n\nSpeaker: SHY\n\n\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u53f0\u5927\u6559\u52d9\u8655\u64d4\u4efb\u7cfb\u7d71\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e2b",
