  "description": "Talk: Hoist Your I/O\n\nOur programs too often leave control decisions stranded in low-level routines, producing tightly coupled systems that make it difficult to re-use code. What are the warning signs of tightly coupled I/O and how can it be corrected? Particular attention will be paid to the way that modern Python syntax supports a broader array of solutions than were once possible!\n\nSpeaker: Brandon Rhodes. Brandon is a programmer and instructor working at Dropbox, and is excited that this is his third chance to speak at a Python event in Poland.  For 17 years Brandon has maintained the most popular amateur astronomy library for Python, and will be the Chair of PyCon 2016\u20132017 in Portland, Oregon.\n\nSlides: http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/slides/2015-05-pywaw/hoist/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
