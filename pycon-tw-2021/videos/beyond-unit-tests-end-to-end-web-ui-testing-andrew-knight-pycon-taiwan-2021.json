    "description": "Day 1, 11:35-12:05\n\nAbstract\n\nUnit tests are great, but they don\u2019t catch all bugs because they don\u2019t test features like a user. However, Web UI tests are complicated and notoriously unreliable. So, how can we write tests well? Never fear! Let\u2019s learn how to write robust, scalable Web UI tests using Python, pytest, and Selenium WebDriver that cover the full stack for any Web app. In this talk, we will write one simple test together that covers DuckDuckGo searching. You\u2019ll learn how to write battle-hardened Web UI tests for any Web app, including Django and Flask apps. I\u2019ll also provide plenty of hands-on tutorials and resources to continue learning after this talk.\n\nDescription\n\nWeb UI testing is difficult because many folks don't know how to do it, or they aren't experienced in how to handle fine details like locators or race conditions. In this talk, you will learn how to automate tests in Python using pytest and Selenium WebDriver. We will cover:\n\nUsing Selenium WebDriver like a pro\nModeling Web UI interactions with page objects\nWriting \u201cgood\u201d feature tests that are efficient, robust, and readable\nDeciding what should and should not be tested with automation\nConsidering Playwright as a Selenium alternative\nThe example code is here:\nhttps://github.com/AndyLPK247/tau-intro-selenium-py\n\nI also developed courses for Test Automation University on this topic:\n\nhttps://testautomationu.applitools.com/pytest-tutorial/\nhttps://testautomationu.applitools.com/selenium-webdriver-python-tutorial/\nhttps://testautomationu.applitools.com/web-element-locator-strategies/\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\nHackMD: https://hackmd.io/@pycontw/2021/%2F%40pycontw%2Fry4OQeYMt\n\nSpeaker: Andrew Knight\n\nPandy Knight is the \u201cAutomation Panda\u201d - an engineer, consultant, and international speaker who builds solutions for software testing problems.
