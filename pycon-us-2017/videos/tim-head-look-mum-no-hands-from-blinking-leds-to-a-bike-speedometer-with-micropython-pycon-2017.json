  "description": "In this talk I will show you how to use a micro-controller to build a\nwifi enabled speedometer for your bike, using MicroPython. And some\nhardware. And a bike (maybe). I will introduce you to the world of\nMicroPython: a python distribution that runs on micro-controllers.\nMicro-controllers are small computers that are all around us: in cars,\nTVs, and your internet connected fridge. We will start with making LEDs\nblink, then serve webpages, build an interrupt handler and finally put\nit all together to make a wifi enabled speedometer for a bike.\n",
