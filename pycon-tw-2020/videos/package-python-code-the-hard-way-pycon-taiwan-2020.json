  "description": "Day 2, 14:30\u201315:00\n\nYou have Python code to publish. First, create setup.py, and setup.cfg, MANIFEST.in, pyproject.toml\u2026 What are all these stuff? Python packaging is so confusing! In this talk, we are going to throw all them away, and build a package from the ground up. Because Python packages are not hard, I promise!\n\nSlides: https://packaging-the-hard-way.readthedocs.io\n\nSpeaker: Tzu-ping Chung\n\nTP builds his career around open source software, and enjoys committing his efforts to help make the world better. He builds all kinds of software for a living, from embedded system to single-page web applications, and contributes to the community when he can.\n\nThese days, he spends most of his time improving Python\u2019s packaging landscape, organising PyCon Taiwan, and building software with Python and other modern technologies. He loves (human) languages, and knows probably too much about linguistics and phonetics to make him boring in parties.\n\nTP \u7684\u8077\u696d\u751f\u6daf\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u958b\u6e90\u8edf\u9ad4\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u559c\u6b61\u82b1\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7cbe\u529b\u8b93\u9019\u500b\u4e16\u754c\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u70ba\u4e86\u751f\u6d3b\u800c\u5beb\u904e\u5404\u5f0f\u5404\u6a23\u7684\u8edf\u9ad4\uff0c\u5f9e\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7d71\u5230 SPA \u90fd\u662f\u72e9\u7375\u7bc4\u570d\uff0c\u4e14\u53ea\u8981\u6709\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c31\u6703\u76e1\u91cf\u56de\u994b\u793e\u7fa4\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6642\u9593\u5927\u591a\u82b1\u5728\u5c0d Python packaging \u7684\u6539\u5584\u3001\u7c4c\u8fa6 PyCon Taiwan\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528 Python \u8207\u73fe\u4ee3\u524d\u7aef\u6280\u8853\u958b\u767c\u8edf\u9ad4\u548c\u61c9\u7528\u7a0b\u5f0f\u3002\u4ed6\u6709\u9ede\u592a\u559c\u6b61\uff08\u4eba\u985e\uff09\u8a9e\u8a00\uff0c\u5e38\u5e38\u626f\u5230\u592a\u591a\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u548c\u8a9e\u97f3\u5b78\uff0c\u8b93\u804a\u5929\u5167\u5bb9\u8b8a\u5f97\u7121\u804a\u3002",
