  "description": "At WIDE IO, we are specialists in image processing and video analytics;\nwe have individual experience using Python, Numpy and Scipy for Computer\nVision applications since 2007. Now, the environment has become much\nmature. Our goal with this talk is to share our enthusiasm and to\npresent the basic steps required to perform image and video pattern\nanalysis with Python. In our tutorial, we\u2019ll investigate how to build an\naction recognition framework and how to do video-tracking with\ntraditional vision models based on a bag-of- keypoints. By going through\nexamples, we\u2019ll discuss how in practice computer vision for\nreal-applications involve a trade-off between esthetical theories and\nutilitarianism. We will explore the various tricks that allow engineers\nto boost global performances, methods for running experiments and a\nmechanism for how to prepare the data... All these points are just a\nnice pretext to discuss our favorite tools: Numpy and Scipy of course,\nbut also more exotic ones such as MediaLovinToolkit, PyCUDA, Bob and\nPyCVF... At the end of the talk, we\u2019ll conclude by briefly discussing\nfuture imperatives, especially with respect to mobility and cloud\ncomputing.\n",
