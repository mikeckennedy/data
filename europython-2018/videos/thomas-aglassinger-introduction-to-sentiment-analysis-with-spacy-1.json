  "description": "Sentiment analysis aims at extracting opinions from texts written in\nnatural language, typically reviews or comments on social sites and\nforums. SpaCy already provides mechanisms for dealing with natural\nlanguages in general but does not offer means for sentiment analysis.\n\nThis talk gives a short introduction to sentiment analysis in general\nand shows how to extract topics and ratings by utilizing spaCy\u2019s basic\ntools and extending them with a lexicon based approach and simple Python\ncode to consolidate sentiments spread over multiple words.\n\nTopic covered are:\n\n-  What is sentiment analysis?\n-  Levels of sentiment detection\n-  Representing opinions\n-  Splitting texts in sentences and words.\n-  Finding the base word (lemma)\n-  Extending spaCy\u2019s pipeline and tokens\n-  Matching words to topics and ratings\n-  Combining multiple words to a rating\n\nCode examples are introduced and explained using a Jupyter notebook that\ncan be used as basis for your own analysis.\n\nAs additional twist the analyzed texts are not in English but German to\nshow that this approach can be used for multiple languages. No knowledge\nof German is required though because translations of the short examples\nsentences are provided.\n",
