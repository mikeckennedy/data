  "description": "From writing and committing to publishing and promoting makesite.py, a static site generator for Python coders\n\nThis session is about my personal journey of creating and publishing my\nfirst successful open source project in Python. I will share a story\nthat starts with rewriting my static, shell-script-powered personal blog\ngenerator, then writing 120 lines of Python code, publishing it on\nHacker News, and then trending on Hacker News and GitHub (right next to\nLinus Torvalds :-D) for a day of hacker-fame.\n\nIn this session, I will share how 120 lines of Python code written to\nsolve a personal need helped me to connect with developers across the\nworld and become a part of a small community of Python coders. I believe\nthis session will be very useful to beginners who want to take their\nfirst step into creating their own personal Python project and make it\nsuccessful.\n\nVisit https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite to see the source code of\nthis project.",
