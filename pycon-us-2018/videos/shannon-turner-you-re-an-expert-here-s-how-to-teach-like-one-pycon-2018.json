  "description": "Knowing how to code and being able to teach it are two separate skills. When we have expertise in a subject, it's common to take for granted that we'll be able to effectively communicate our expertise to someone else. Come learn (or re-learn!) how to teach and discover practical examples you can put to work right away.\n\nBy sharpening your teaching skills, you'll be a more effective mentor, trainer, and team member.",
