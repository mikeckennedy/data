  "description": "` <http://blip.tv/file/2023897>`__\n\nSQLAlchemy is the premier SQL toolkit for Python. SQLAlchemy exposes the\nfull power of SQL while remaining easy to use for the basics, and is\nflexible enough to work with existing database schemas as well as fresh\ndesigns. SQLAlchemy is used in production by leading Python web\nframeworks Pylons and TurboGears as well as many other web and non-web\ndevelopers. This tutorial discusses current data mapping techniques,\nadvanced Query techniques, Session/transaction usage, and maximizing\nschema usage with SQLAlchemy's event model.\n",
