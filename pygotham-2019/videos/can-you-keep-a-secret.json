  "description": "We\u2019ve all been guilty of hard-coding secrets at some point. It\u2019s just a\nquick hack, and you\u2019ll definitely go back and tidy it up later. But then you\nforget, and it\u2019s all too easy to `git push` your API keys to GitHub.\n\nThis easy to make mistake could end up [costing you thousands of\ndollars](https://dev.to/juanmanuelramallo/i-was-billed-for-14k-usd-on-\namazon-web-services-17fn), and with the [median time to discovery for a\nsecret key leaked to GitHub being 20 seconds](https://www.ndss-\nsymposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ndss2019_04B-3_Meli_paper.pdf) you\ncould end up compromised before you have a chance to correct your error.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll look at techniques that you can use personally and\nwithin your development teams to properly store, share, and manage your\nsecrets, as easily as possible without disrupting your workflow.",
