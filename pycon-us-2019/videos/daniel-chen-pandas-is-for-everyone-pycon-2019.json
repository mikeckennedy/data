  "description": "Data Science and Machine learning have been synonymous with languages\nlike Python. Libraries like Numpy and Pandas have become the de facto\nstandard when working with data. The DataFrame object provided by Pandas\ngives us the ability to work with heterogeneous unstructured data that\nis commonly used in \"real world\" data.\n\nNew learners are often drawn to Python and Pandas because of all the\ndifferent and exciting types of models and insights the language can do\nand provide, but are awestruck when faced with the initial learning\ncurve.\n\nThis tutorial aims to guide the learner from using spreadsheets to using\nthe Pandas DataFrame. Not only does moving to a programming language\nallow the user to have a more reproducible workflow, but as datasets get\nlarger, some cannot even be opened in a spreadsheet program. The goal is\nto have an absolute beginner proficient enough with Pandas that they can\nstart working with data in Python.\n\nWe will cover how to load and view our data and introduce what Dr.\nHadley Wickham has coined \"tidy data\". Tidy data is an important concept\nbecause the process of tidying data will fix a host of data problems\nthat are needed to perform analytics. We then cover functions and\napplying methods to our data with a focus on data cleaning, and how we\ncan use the concept of split-apply-combine (groupby) to summarize or\nreduce our data.\n\nFinally, we cover the role of Pandas in analysis packages such as scikit\nlearn. The tutorial will end with a fitted model.\n\nThe goal is to get people familiar with Python and Pandas so they can\nlearn and explore many other parts of the Python ecosystem (e.g., scikit\nlearn, dask, seaborn, etc).\n",
