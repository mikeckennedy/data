  "description": "In this talk we are gonna explore launching and maintaining highly scalable data pipelines using Kubernetes. We are gonna go through the process of setting up a Pachyderm cluster and deploying Python-based data processing workloads. This setup enables teams to develop and maintain very robust data pipelines, with the benefits of autoscaling clusters and quick code iteration.",
