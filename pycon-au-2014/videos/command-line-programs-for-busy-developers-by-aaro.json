  "description": "Command line interface tools are the new web framework. In addition to\nthe Python standard library's getopt, optparse and argparse there is a\nbewildering array of packages available on the Python Packaging Index.\nPackages like Click, Cliff, Docopt, Invoke all provide different\nmechanics for creating command line applications. When all you want to\ndo is expose a command line and get back to creating functionality, it\u2019s\nhard to know which alternative to reach for.\n\nThis presentation will have two parts, the first half will be a brief\nsurvey of popular modules. Strengths, weaknesses and design philosophies\nwill be compared by creating command line processing for the same\nexample program.\n\nThe second half will go into more depth on a specific package, Begins.\nThis package was authored by the presenter to minimise the disruption\ndevelopers experience when breaking flow to implement command line\nprocessing. The audience will be shown how a single line of code can\ncreate a complex command line interface. It will also be shown how a\nhandful of decorators from the Begins API can eliminate boilerplate code\nand create powerful, complex applications.\n",
