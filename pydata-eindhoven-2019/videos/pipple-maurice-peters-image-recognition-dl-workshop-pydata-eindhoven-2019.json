  "description": "A DL workshop where we apply Deep Learning to satelite imagery.\n\nPipple will be presenting a workshop that will give the audience a\nhands-on tutorial focusing on deep learning. Deep-learning is part of\nthe world\u2019s most cutting edge technology that will undoubtedly impact\nhuman life in the upcoming years. It is used in driverless cars, voice\nassistance, facial recognition and even controversial topics like\ndeepfakes. During the workshop the audience will be guided in the\nmathematics that is involved in this subset of machine learning and\nartificial intelligence, after which they will develop their own deep\nlearning network by the use of a Jupyter Notebook tutorial. The goal of\nthis tutorial is to classify roof shapes and materials of houses in an\naerial image. A real-life use-case of how 510 (i.e. Data team of the\nNetherlands Red Cross) was able to improve damage assesment to improve\nhumanitarian aid in disaster responses. After the tutorial, participants\nare encouraged to further improve their models during Friday/Saturday.\nThe winning team will be made public on Saturday during the conference\ntalks.\n\nIn order to receive access to the course materials we would like you to\nregister here: https://www.pipple.nl/pydata-2019-workshop/\n",
