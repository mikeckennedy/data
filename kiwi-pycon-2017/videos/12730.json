  "description": "The Automat project is a pythonic approach to state machines, in that the user describes all their states, inputs and outputs using standard python idioms. Automat encapsulates your use of a state machine, users of your state machine don't actually have to learn about state machines, or even know there's a state machine inside, all they call are standard Python methods on an instance.",
