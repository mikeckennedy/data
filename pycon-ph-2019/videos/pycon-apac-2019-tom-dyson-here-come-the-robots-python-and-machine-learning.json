  "description": "Machine Learning is probably the most important development in our industry (and possibly our civilisation!). Previously restricted to math geniuses with access to supercomputers and massive data centres, machine learning tools are increasingly available as web services which are easily consumed from more traditional web applications. Python has become the lingua franca of machine learning, so Python developers are well placed to take advantage of the next wave of application development. This talk outlines the various machine learning platforms and provides a set of practical examples that demonstrate how Python developers can start taking advantage of artificial intelligence in their own applications.  The intended audience is pretty wide: web developers, students, data scientists should all come away with a set of ideas and tools for implementing machine learning without needing a degree in artificial intelligence!",
