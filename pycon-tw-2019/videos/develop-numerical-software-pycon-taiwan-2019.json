  "description": "Day 2, R1 13:15\u201314:00\n\nNumerical software development is a unique subject.  On one hand, programming skills and computer science are indispensable for proper implementation.  On the other hand, the understandings to the scientific or engineering problems are the foundation of the software.  The fundamental knowledge is so important that the application experts, e.g., mathematicians and scientists, often become the best programmers.  However, it is difficult to train people for the multi-disciplinary skills.  This talk will discuss how Python makes the development and training manageable.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/yyc/develop-numerical-software-pycontw-2019\n\nSpeaker: Yung-Yu Chen\n\nHPC software developer.",
