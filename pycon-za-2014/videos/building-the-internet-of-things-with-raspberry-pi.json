  "summary": "With the advent of the low cost Raspberry Pi computer, anyone with a\nsoldering iron and some basic Python skills can take everyday objects\nand transform them into fully networked, smart devices. In this talk, I\nwill show you how I hacked a Raspberry Pi into my home alarm system,\nturning my network of IP cameras into motion triggered sensors. I will\nshow you how to build basic input and output circuits and introduce you\nto the RPi.GPIO Python module. We\u2019ll talk about how you can build a\nRESTful server on your Raspberry Pi to enable remote access. And\nfinally, more ideas for hacking everyday objects around the home! No\nprior electronics knowledge required.\n",
