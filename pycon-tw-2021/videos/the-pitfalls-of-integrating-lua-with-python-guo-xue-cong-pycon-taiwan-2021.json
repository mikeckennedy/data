    "description": "Day 1, 11:35-12:05\n\nAbstract\n\nIn some domain of computer & information industries, such as, gaming, Lua is an excellent embedded script language. It can be used to describe daily changed business logic and rule description, but keep consuming little resource including CPU and memory. If we need to offer programmable part in a Python based executable or system for non-programmer, such as game master and multimedia creator, Lua is a well choice. Integrating Lua with Python seems to be easy when using Lua modules from PyPI, but actually has some pitfalls inside, including isolation and complex data exchanging. So I will share some experiences and hope who want to integrate Lua with Python could avoid these traps.\n\nDescription\n\nThis talk is related to:\n\nSome core parts of Python script language\nLua script language\nPython module to interact with Lua\nlupa\nluadata\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\nHackMD: https://hackmd.io/@pycontw/2021/%2F%40pycontw%2FBJf1UgFGK\n\nSpeaker: \u90ed\u5b78\u8070 (Hsueh-Tsung Kuo)\n\n\u53f0\u7063\u67d0game\u6703\u793e\u7684\u5c0f\u5c0fRD\u76ee\u524d\u662fCPPRG(C# Perl Python Ruby Golang)\u719f\u624bSmalltalk\u8207Scheme\u57fa\u672c\u6559\u7fa9\u6d3e\u4e0d\u662f\u592a\u5947\u602a\u7684\u7a0b\u5f0f\u8a9e\u8a00\u90fd\u6703\u4e00\u4e9b\u8acb\u591a\u591a\u6307\u6559\u239d\uff08\u02f6\u2032\u25e1\u2035\u02f6\uff09\u23a0",
