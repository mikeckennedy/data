  "abstract": "Iteratively building a classifier requires a mix of skill, diagnostic\nability and guesswork. I'll lay out a framework that helps you build\nreliable classifiers with greater confidence and less random guesswork.\nWe'll review different ways to tackle a classification challenge, visual\ndiagnostics that help identify sources of error and missing but\nexploitable information and tools to help you simplify your final\nsolution. Tools demonstrated will include sklearn, YellowBrick, ELI5,\npandas\\_profiling and skopt. The approaches we'll discuss will apply\nequally to regression challenges. Whilst this talk is aimed at\nIntermediate Data Scientists, people at the start of their career will\nbenefit by having a clear process and by being introduced to new tools.\n\nSlides `linked\nhere <http://ianozsvald.com/2018/04/30/pydatalondon-2018-and-%20creating-correct-and-capable-classifiers/>`__\n",
