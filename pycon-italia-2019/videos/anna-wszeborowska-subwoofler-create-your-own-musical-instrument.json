  "description": "Have you, like me, started your musical encounters with toys that made\nanimal sounds? Has the teenage you wondered how your favorite beat\nmakers turned field recordings into playable sounds? What would happen\nif you combined the two? Let me take you on a journey through the world\nof sampling instruments which inspired Subwoofler - a barking sampler\nwritten completely in Python. We\u2019ll go through all of its components and\nlearn a few concepts commonly used in music applications. Finally, we\u2019ll\ncompare the performance of processing real-time audio on different\nimplementations of Python; the language which is not the most typical\nchoice for such a use case.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1801\n\nin \\_\\_on **Sunday 5 May** at 14:30 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
