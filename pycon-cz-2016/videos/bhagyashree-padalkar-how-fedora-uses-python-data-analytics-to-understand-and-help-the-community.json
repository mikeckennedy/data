  "description": "I have been involved with Fedora Community Operations Team from its\nconception one year ago. Amongst other things we at CommOps are\ntrying to build tools to understand the community and make it more\ncontributor-friendly. While newcomer onboarding is important for any\nFOSS community, retaining them is critical. We have been working on\nimproving the contributor retention rates in Fedora Community for a\nwhile now. In this direction, we have built some Python-based scripts\nto understand the activity of Fedora contributors and their life\ncycles. We have also tried to analyze contribution activity of some\nsuccessful contributors and find common patterns in their behavior\nand have tried to measure the impact of attending FOSS events on the\nactivity of a contributor and on the Fedora community as a whole. All\nthis work has been done using Python and during this talk, I want to\nshare details about the tools we have built, how we built them and\nthe insights we have generated from them.",
