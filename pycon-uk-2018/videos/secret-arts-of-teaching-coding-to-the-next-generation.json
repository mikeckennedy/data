  "description": "The Secret & Undiscovered Arts of Teaching Coding to the Next Generation Successfully\n\nComputer Science is now the leading discipline of the 21st century.\nComputers and technology are now ubiquitous and prevalent in all sectors\nof society such as the arts, sciences, medicine, commerce, etc.\nTechnology also plays a huge role in the world economy and the market\ncapitalisation of the FAANGs' Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and\nAlphabet\u2019s Google along with a couple of other technologies is more or\nless equivalent to the GDP of Japan - the world's 3rd richest nation.\nTherefore, computer programming is now regarded as an essential skill\nfor the young person, and it has been dubbed the \u20184th\u2019 R\u2019 (computer\npRogramming) along with reading, writing and arithmetic.\n\n| In recognition of the new status of computer programming, governments\n  worldwide have launched initiatives to have it taught in schools from\n  Kindergarten through to junior school and all the way through\n  secondary school.\n| So, the question emerges is how do we best teach the next generation\n  in acquiring this skill? Given the fact that this field is very much\n  in its infancy, there is very little pedagogy to guide the educator.\n  Therefore, the whole world is learning how best to teach this subject\n  by trial and error.\n\nThe talk will describe a case study whereby coding/computer programming,\nin the form of Python, was introduced to a group of 110 young people\nfrom the ages of 11 to 18 (Years 7-13 in an UK secondary school). The\ntalk will include descriptions of the various teaching methodologies\nintroduced to the young people for this purpose and the outcomes; the\ntalk will also address various challenges and questions about how to\nteach programming to young people. The talk will conclude with helpful\nsuggestions, based on the findings of the case study, on how to proceed\nwith the teaching of computer programming to these people.",
