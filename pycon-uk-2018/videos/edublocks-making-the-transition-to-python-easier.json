  "description": "Bridging the gap between block based and text based programming\n\nMoving from block based programming to text based programming just got\neasier. In this session 14 year old Josh @all\\_about\\_code talks about\nhow you can bridge this gap by using EduBlocks, a program which he has\ndeveloped. EduBlocks is a drag and drop version of Python 3 which allows\nstudents to learn the Python syntax with minimal errors, allowing\nyounger children to access Python. The aim of EduBlocks is to make the\ntransition from block based programs like Scratch to Python easier for\nstudents and teachers, as presently there is no drop-in solution that\nbridges this gap. EduBlocks is currently being used in 72 different\ncountries around the world by students and teachers alike and has\nrecently included a micro:bit editor. Josh will talk you through how his\nexperiences of being a student in the classroom gave him the idea to\ndevelop EduBlocks. He will explain the advantages of using EduBlocks in\nthe classroom, from the features it includes to the resources and lesson\nplans available and how educators and the tech community can contribute\ntheir ideas to this completely free Open Source program.",
