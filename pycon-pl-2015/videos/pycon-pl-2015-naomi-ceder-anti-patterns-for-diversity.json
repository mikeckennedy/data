  "description": "For many years studies have shown that more diverse teams are more creative and flexible and produce better solutions. In addition both the demand for more tech talent and basic fairness also support increased diversity and inclusion. Just as there is no single easy way to write good code there is no single easy way to increase diversity. There are, however, several things that companies and organizations do which actually work against diversity. This talk will explore these anti-patterns for diversity, including uncritical belief in meritocracy, lack of understanding of the realities of marginalization, null processes, misunderstanding of \u201cculture fit\u201d, and an unwillingness to change, as well as some ways that teams, companies, and organizations might work to combat them.",
