  "description": "Making computer games is difficult: it requires creativity,\nmultidisciplinary knowledge of art, psychology, math, computer science,\nphysics and others, patience, open mind and dedication. Making computer\ngames with Python is a nightmare. You hit practically every sharp corner\nthat Python has, starting with installation, through binary libraries,\npoor hardware support, up to distribution.\n\nPewPew devices are an attempt at solving the worst problems by giving\nyou a dedicated, cheap, simple and portable gaming device, that you can\neasily program with Python with just a simple text editor. They also\nmake pretty neat conference badges. I will talk about how they were\nconceived, how they are used, and how you can extend and improve them\nyourself.\n\nAt the end of the talk you should have a good idea about what is\nCircuitPython and MicroPython and how they can be used to build and\nprogram such simple devices. You should also know where to find the\nresources necessary to try designing and building your own.",
