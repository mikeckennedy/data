  "description": "Apache Spark is becoming the new lingua franca for distributed\ncomputing. In this talk I'll show how many machine learning tasks can be\nscaled up almost trivially using Spark.\n\nAfter introducing the Spark computational model I'll detail some useful\ndesign principles for running Spark programs on large datasets. I'll\nalso give some tips for effective configuration of a PySpark cluster.\n\nThe talk will include a step-by-step walk through of the scaling-up of\nseveral NLP algorithms. For instance, we'll see how a semi-supervised\nNLP algorithm can be trained on a billion training examples using a\nPySpark cluster.\n",
