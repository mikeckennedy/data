  "description": "Speaker: Alexander Engelhardt\n\nTrack:PyData\nComplex machine learning models make better predictions, but at the cost of turning into an unexplainable black-box model. In this talk, we'll look into a framework that allows us to explain why a model makes a specific prediction.\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2019 conference.\nhttps://pycon.de\n\nMore details at the conference page: https://de.pycon.org/program/ZKXNTB\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pyconde",
