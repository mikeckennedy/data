  "description": "Python has dozens of plotting libraries, which is a blessing and a\ncurse. It can be difficult to choose libraries, learn how to use them,\nand make them work together when needed. This talk introduces PyViz.org,\na new initiative to integrate existing OSS tools into a full suite that\nsolves a wide range of problems in data exploration and communication.\nBokeh implements interactive browser-based plotting, Datashader renders\neven huge datasets into manageable images, HoloViews makes it simple to\nconstruct Bokeh+Datashader plots, and other PyViz packages tie all these\ntools together to allow simple creation of visual applications and\ndashboards.Presenter(s): Speaker: James A. Bednar, Solutions Architect,\nAnaconda, Inc. Speaker: Jean-Luc Stevens, Software Engineer, Anaconda,\nInc. Speaker: Philipp Rudiger, Software Engineer, Anaconda, Inc.\nSpeaker: Christopher Ball, Anaconda, Inc. Speaker: Bryan Van de Ven,\nAnaconda, Inc.\n",
