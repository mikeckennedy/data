  "description": "\"Hacking Django Channels for Fun (and Profit)\" by: Calvin Hendryx-Parker\n\nDjango is growing some great async features and Channels has been great for handling websockets connecting from your visitor's browser. But what happens when you need to do more? What if you want to keep long-running connections from Django to other websockets, such as Discord servers?  How do you do this and still leverage all the batteries included with Django? We will show an approach that makes this all possible and easy as a developer.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
