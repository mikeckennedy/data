  "description": "A great strength of Django is how much functionality there is baked in\nwithout the developer doing anything to obtain it.\n\nA corollary of this is that there\u2019s a great deal of functionality in\nDjango which the average developer is hardly aware exists. The happy dev\nis pleased to ignore the problems that have been solved for them as\ntheir requests rush in and their responses rush out.\n\nThere's Middleware, Signals, Authentication, Caching,\nInternationalization, Serialization and ... a lot more and that's just\nthe core framework.\n\nIn this talk we\u2019re going to stop and admire the view .\n\nWe\u2019ll demonstrate the effects that these core aspects of Django have on\na request - response cycle by reviewing how they work and feeling the\npain of what life would be like without them.\n\nMy talk is aimed at the average Django dev who has been happy to ignore\nwhat goes on under the hood. By better understanding the machinery that\nDjango relies on it gives us all the opportunity to exploit it in our\nwork and, of course, to impress our colleagues!\n",
