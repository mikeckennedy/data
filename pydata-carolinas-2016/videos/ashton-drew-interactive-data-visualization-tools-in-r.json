  "description": "An introduction to the R packages that generate interactive table and\ngraphics. The focus will be on R Shiny, but I will also summarize\nvalue of other options, such as leaflet, plotly, ggvis, and rCharts.\n\nWith interactive and reactive data visualizations, your audience\ndirectly engages with your data for stronger communication and better\nunderstanding. The Shiny apps can easily be launched directly to the\nweb via shinyapps.io or Shiny Server to be run by anyone (they don't\nneed to download your data or have R). This course assumes\nparticipants can already perform data analysis and visualization in R,\nbut want to expand their skills with R Shiny. Therefore, the class\nexercises focus on transcribing code from a static to an interactive\npresentation of data products and information. Students must bring\ntheir own laptop with a current version of R and R Studio. Outline: -\nOverview of available interactive tools in R - Exercise to build a\nsimple Shiny app - Shiny setup and orientation - Introduction to Shiny\ncode structure - Overview of basic widgets - Example of conditional\nreactivity",
