  "description": "In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Bank of America Merrill Lynch embarked on an ambitious plan to realign its sales and trading systems around the Python-based Quartz platform.  More than half way through this journey, we have millions of lines of Python under our belt and major business deliverables behind us.
