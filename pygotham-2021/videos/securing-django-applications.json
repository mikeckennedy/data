  "description": "Django is the most popular Python-based web framework used for creating web\napplications. The web applications are vulnerable for various reasons\nincluding a) configuration settings of the web applications b) lack of\nimplementation of security best practices and secure coding and c) lack of\nawareness of secure first web applications among developers. The vulnerable\nweb applications put the data of the customers at greater risk and the\ncompromised code can lead to problems beyond control. It is very important\nto develop secure web applications to protect customer data and code to\nmitigate the risk. In this talk, we will focus on two aspects. First,\nperforming penetration testing on Django web applications to identify\nvulnerabilities and scanning for Open Web Application Security Project\n(OWASP) Top 10 risks. Second, strategies and configuration settings for\nmaking the source code and Django applications secure. We will also discuss\nthe Djangohunter tool to identify incorrectly configured Django applications\nthat are exposing sensitive information.",
