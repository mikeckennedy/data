  "description": "A grammar is, according to Wikipedia, the set of structural rules\ngoverning the composition of clauses, phrases, and words in any given\nnatural language. A grammar of graphics is then the set of structural\nrules governing the composition of visual elements. Transforming data\ninto visual representations using composition is quite powerful and\nallows to create complex visualisations with simple building blocks.\n\nWhile the ideas behind the grammar of graphics date back well into the\n80s, as a Python developer it is only quite recently that we can make\nuse of it. Altair, backed by the vega specification, is one of the few\nplotting libraries in Python that provide such a declarative and\ncompositional API.\n\nIn this talk I will give an introduction to the core concepts behind the\ngrammar of graphics as well as practical examples how to use altair API\nin Python to create vega plots.\n",
