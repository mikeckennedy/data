  "description": "HotPy (2) is a new interpreter for Python. It is binary compatible with\nCPython and reuses CPython\u2019s object and module implementations. The core\ninterpreter is new and uses many of the techniques developed during the\n1990s and 2000s plus a technique developed during my PhD. Once the first\nstage of the optimisation chain is completed (May or June), HotPy is\nexpected to be between 2 and 3 times as fast as CPython. It will\nprobably never be as fast as PyPy, but it might be possible to get\nclose. During the talk I will explain how it works (with lots of\npictures), and how it compares to CPython and PyPy. I will also discuss\nwhether the techniques used in HotPy would be suitable for Jython and\nIronPython.\n",
