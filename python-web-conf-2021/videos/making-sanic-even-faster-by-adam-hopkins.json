  "description": "\"Making Sanic Even Faster\" by: Adam Hopkins\nSanic is one of the fastest growing frameworks in the Python world. But it is also simply one of the fastest Python web servers. This year, we are making it even faster.\n\nThere are a number of under the hood changes planned for 2021 as Sanic gears up for its first \u201cstable\u201d release at the end of the year. You can read about some of the changes here: https://community.sanicframework.org/t/2021-development-plan/783\nThis talk will focus on *why* these changes are being made, and *how* we are achieving them.\n\nTime permitting, I will also do a little demonstration about deploying production ready, high performance applications in the new world and show the practical impact.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
