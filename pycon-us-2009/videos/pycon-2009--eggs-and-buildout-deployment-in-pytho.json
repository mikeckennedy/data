  "description": "Puzzled about Python eggs and packages? Wondering how to repeatably pull\ntogether collections of packages into standalone development, testing\nand deployment environments, all while managing inter-dependencies? In\nthis participatory tutorial, we'll start with distutils, walk through\nusing eggs in the cheeseshop and creating your own eggs, touch a bit on\nusing virtualenv to set up a development environment, and then dig into\nusing zc.buildout to rigorously control assembly specifications, with\nbuild recipes, versioning and dependency management. We'll close by\nshowing how to create your own recipes. Attendees are strongly\nencouraged to bring a laptop or partner with someone who does.\n",
