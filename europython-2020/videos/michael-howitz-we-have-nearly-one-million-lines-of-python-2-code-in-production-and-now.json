  "description": "Porting a rather large code base to Python 3 \u2013 lessons learned usable for projects of any size\n\nIn this talk I am going to present possible approaches for a Python 3 migration of existing Python code running on Python 2.7. I'll evaluate which of these approaches seems suitable for a large code base and which principles should be paid attention to to increase the probability of a successful migration project.\r\n\r\nI'll use union.cms (a content management system used by German trade unions) to show the story of a successful migration project involving nearly one million lines of Python code. The story will include the obstacles we encountered and what we learned on the way.\r\n\r\nI believe that most of the discussed ideas and experience can also be used unchanged in smaller projects as the presented principles are very much the same.\r\n\r\nGoal of the presentation: You should be able to come up with a plan for migrating your Python 2 based projects to Python 3.",
