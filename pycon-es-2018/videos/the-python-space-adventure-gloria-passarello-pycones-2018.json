  "description": "Do you you remember the last time you took a sunburn? Have you ever wonder why this happen? It\u2019s UV\u2019s fault: Ultraviolet Rays. But what are they exactly? How can we obtain this information?\n\nWith this talk we will explore a new type of data obtained with Sentinel 5P Satellite, https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-5p . We will talk about the most ambitious earth observation programme in the world: Copernicus. We will see how Python can easily handle the entire workflow: from downloading to processing and finally visualization.\n\nWe will explore a spatial dataset about ultraviolet radiation and the main pollutants on the air we breathe: NO, NO2, O3, PM 10, PM2.5\u2026\n\nWith a live demo in pure Python we will see how to visualize the spatial data using Jupyter and numpy, matplotlib and pygrib modules.\n\nAn example of the code could be found here: https://github.com/Randbee/Copernicus_UV_data\n",
