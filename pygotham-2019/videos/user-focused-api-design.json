  "description": "When we talk about Web API Design, we're usually driven to think in\narchitecture, verbs and nouns. But we often forget our user: the developer.\n\nUX designers rely on many techniques to create great experiences. User\nresearch, User Testing, Personas, Usage Data Analysis and others. However\nwhen creating `invisible products` we\u2019re not used to think in usability. So\nwhy don\u2019t we take advantage of this background to improve our APIs\nexperiences?\n\nUser experience refers to a person\u2019s emotions and attitudes about using a\nparticular product, system or service. If your API is poorly designed,\ndocumented or hard to start using and there is no requirement for the\ndeveloper to use it, they won\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s more likely for them to build\nsomething from scratch to replace your API rather than use it.\n\nIn this talk, I'll show some processes commonly used by UX designers and how\nwe can use them to create a great developer experience.",
