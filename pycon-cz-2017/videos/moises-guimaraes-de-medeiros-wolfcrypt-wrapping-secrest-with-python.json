  "description": "The ancient art of keeping secrets safe is nowadays one of the\npillars of the internet. e-commerce, online banking, video\nconferences and a lot of other things are protected by encryption to\nbecome viable. Becoming fluent in basic cryptographic operations is a\nprecious tool for any software developer.\n\nwolfcrypt is a Python library that encapsulates wolfSSL\u2019s wolfCrypt\nAPI. wolfCrypt is a lightweight, portable, C-language-based crypto\nlibrary targeted at IoT, embedded, and RTOS environments primarily\nbecause of its size, speed, and feature set. It works seamlessly in\ndesktop, enterprise, and cloud environments as well. It is the crypto\nengine behind wolfSSl\u2019s embedded ssl library.\n\nI will talk about classic and modern cryptography concepts a.k.a.\ncryptography 101 and use the wolfcrypt python module to put those\nconcepts in practice to keep information safe.\n\n------\n\nMois\u00e9s Guimar\u00e3es is a Brazilian pythonista who lives in Jo\u00e3o Pessoa,\nthe capital of the state of Para\u00edba in Brazil, also the eastmost\nplace of the Americas. Author of both wolfcrypt and wolfssl modules,\nCFFI wrappers for the wolfSSL crypto and SSL/TLS libraries.\n\nHe works both as a software engineer at wolfSSL and as a professor at\nthe Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of\nPara\u00edba, graduated in Web Development with a specialization degree in\nInformation Security.",
