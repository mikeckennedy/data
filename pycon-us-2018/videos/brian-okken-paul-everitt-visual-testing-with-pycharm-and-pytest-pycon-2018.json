  "description": "Know you should be doing testing but haven\u2019t gotten over the hurdle to learn it? pytest is Python\u2019s modern, friendly, and powerful testing framework. When paired with an IDE, testing gets a visual interface, making it much easier to get started.\n\nIn this talk we cover \u201cvisual testing\u201d: starting, learning, using, and mastering test-driven development (TDD) with the help of a nice UI. We\u2019ll show PyCharm Community Edition, a free and open-source Python IDE, as a productive TDD environment for pytest. Specifically, we\u2019ll show a workflow using pytest and PyCharm that helps make tests speed up development, or at the very least help to make testing seem less \"in the way\" of other development activities",
