  "description": "**Alejandro Saucedo** , Eigen Technologies\n\n`**Industrial Data Pipelines with Python and\nAirflow** <http://pycon.ru/2018/en/program/content/Alejandro/>`__\n\nThis talk will provide a practical deep dive on how to build\nindustry-ready machine learning / data pipelines using Airflow. This\nwill consist of a practical presentation that will build from the basics\nof Airflow, and show how it is possible to build scalable and\ndistributed machine learning data pipelines using a distributed\narchitecture with a Celery backend. I will provide insights on some of\nthe key learnings I've obtained throughout my career building &\ndeploying machine learning systems in critical environments across\nseveral sectors.\n",
