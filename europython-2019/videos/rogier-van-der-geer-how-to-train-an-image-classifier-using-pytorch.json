  "description": "Neural networks are everywhere nowadays. But while it seems everyone is\nusing them, training your first neural network can be quite a hurdle to\novercome.\n\nIn this talk I will take you by the hand, and following an example image\nclassifier I trained, I will take you through the steps of making an\nimage classifier in PyTorch. I will show you code snippets and explain\nthe more intricate parts. Also, I will tell you about my experience, and\nabout what mistakes to prevent. After this all you need to start\ntraining your first classifier is a data set!\n\nOf course I will provide a link to the full codebase at the end. The\ntalk will focus on the practical aspect of training a neural network,\nand will only touch the theoretical side very briefly. Some basic prior\nknowledge of neural networks is beneficial, but not required, to follow\nthis talk.",
