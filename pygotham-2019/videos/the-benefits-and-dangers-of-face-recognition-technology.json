  "description": "Biometric scanners, such as face recognition technology, have seen\nwidespread adoption in applications, such as identifying suspected\ncriminals, analyzing candidate's facial expressions during job interviews,\nand [monitoring attendance at church](https://churchix.com/).\n\nAs these technologies have become more pervasive, many organizations have\nraised potential concerns about the way these technologies schematize faces.\nStudies have shown commercial face recognition software has noticeably lower\naccuracy on darker-skinned individuals, and automatic gender recognition\nsystems regularly misgender trans and non-binary individuals.\n\nIn this talk, I will cover the known limitations of face recognition\ntechnology and the privacy concerns raised about these systems. At the end,\nI will cover how companies and government legislation aims to address these\nconcerns.",
