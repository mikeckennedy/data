  "description": "Since 2011, a community of developers and economists are developing\nOpenFisca, an open source framework in Python that turns law into\nsoftware so it can be used by administrations, economists and\nactivists.\n\nAs the community around OpenFisca grew, we needed to adapt to new\nexpertises, new expectations, and new work habits. The arrival of a\nvery large PR tested of the work we had put in to create a resilient\ncommunity.\n\nIn this talk, I will describe how we worked to create a dynamic\ncommunity that can deal with uncertainty (new contributors, very large\nPRs, \u2026) and grow to reach new heights in the hope it can inspire\nothers.",
