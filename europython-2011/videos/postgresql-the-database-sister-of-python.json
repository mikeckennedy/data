  "description": "This talk is the updated and especially enhanced of the \"Python and\nPostgreSQL - a match made in heaven\" talk of EP 2006, CERN, Switzerland.\nPostgreSQL and Python share more then the first letter: their\ncommunities have great similiarities; their development processes are\nreally comparable; their licenses and their openness to academics AND\nbusiness (on a technical and communitie perspective) are big pluses. We\nwill have a look at those similiarities and learn why PostgreSQL is\nreally the database sister to Python. There will be an overview of\nPostgreSQL, information of how to connect PostgreSQL and Python; how\nPostgreSQL streaming replication works and what it can do for you, how\nPL/Python helps to have Web 2.5 JSON storage and handling right inside\nPostgreSQL. We will show that YESQL is also a valid answer to many data\nstorage qeuestions.\n",
