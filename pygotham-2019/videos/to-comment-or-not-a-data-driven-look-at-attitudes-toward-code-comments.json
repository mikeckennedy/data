  "description": "While most of us agree that commenting is part of writing maintainable code,\nit\u2019s very difficult for someone who has not yet worked in a community-\nreviewed codebase to know what is good practice and not. The answers that\ncome back often conflict each other: Code should be DRY, but well-placed\ncomments save future devs. How can someone find the commenting style that is\nbest for them as they learn, grow, & contribute? My survey of 170 long-time\ndevelopers, Computer Science majors, bootcamp grads, & hobby programmers\nconfirms some expectations and brings others into question. Join me for a\ndata-based chat about the biggest pain points caused by our attitudes toward\ncommenting and the steps we can take to encourage a growth mindset and\nempower programmers of all levels.",
