  "description": "Nowadays, everybody uses version control. But until you learn to\n*misuse* your version control system, you're missing out on ways to\nminimize developer productivity and pessimize your workflow. I'll show\nyou 12 time-tested worst practices that will set you down the wrong path\nfrom Day One.\n\nGreg Ward Bio\n-------------\n\nI've been using and creating open source software since before the term\n\"open source\" was coined, and involved with the Python community since\nthe late nineties. I've written or contributed to several modules in the\nstandard library. And I've been working as a programmer for over 20\nyears. I don't think I've made every mistake in the book, but I've made\na lot of them, and I hope to share some of the things I have learned the\nhard way and save you the trouble.\n",
