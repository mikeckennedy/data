  "description": "Let's say that you want to filter the rows of a DataFrame by multiple conditions. In this video, I'll demonstrate how to do this using two different logical operators. I'll also explain the special rules in pandas for combining filter criteria, and end with a trick for simplifying chained conditions!\n\nThis is video 9 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
