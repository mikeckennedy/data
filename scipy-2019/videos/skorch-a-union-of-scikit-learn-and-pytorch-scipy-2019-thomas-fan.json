  "description": "Skorch is a scikit-learn compatible neural network library that wraps PyTorch. skorch reduces the boilerplate needed to train a neural network by abstracting away the training loop and providing a callback API for common tasks such as recording metrics and model checkpointing. This talk is targeted to users familiar with the scikit-learn API and have had some exposure to neural networks.",
