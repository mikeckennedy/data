  "description": "Bazel is a build system recently open sourced by Google. Even though Python doesn't require 'building' in the traditional way like C++, large code bases can benefit from Bazel's features. Bazel provides powerful tools for expressing and querying dependencies\u2014even between systems in different languages. \n\nIt also makes it possible to bundle applications with all of their dependencies into a hermetic package for distribution. This talk will cover:\n\n1) an introduction to Bazel and how it differs from other build systems, \n2) how Bazel can be used with Python, and \n3) the limitations of Bazel.\n\nSlides available here: http://il.pycon.org/2016/static/sessions/benjamin-peterson.pdf",
