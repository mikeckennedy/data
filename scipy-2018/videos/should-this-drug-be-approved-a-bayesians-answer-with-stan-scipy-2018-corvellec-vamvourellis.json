  "description": "Bayesian hierarchical models can be used for a variety of purposes,\nincluding prediction and causal inference from experimental and\nobservational studies. The benefits of Bayesian modeling include\nuncertainty quantification for all model parameters and predictions, as\nwell as the ability to interpret the outcome. Unfortunately, Bayesian\ninference, the process of fitting such models to datasets, is hard to\nimplement. Stan is the state-of-the-art, open-source Bayesian inference\nengine which makes Bayesian inference much easier to use. We illustrate\nthis with an application of Bayesian modeling in the field of clinical\nresearch, assessing the safety of approving a drug for market. To do\nthis, we use PyStan, the Python interface to Stan.Presenter(s): Speaker:\nMarianne Corvellec, Data Scientist, Institute for Globally Distributed\nOpen Research and Education (IGDORE) Speaker: Konstantinos Vamvourellis,\nLondon School of Economics and Political Science\n",
