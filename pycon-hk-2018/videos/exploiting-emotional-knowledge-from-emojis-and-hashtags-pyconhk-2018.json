  "description": "Grasping other person\u2019s emotions or sentiments through texts is\nchallenging even for humans sometimes. I bet you also have an experience\nthat once you were reading someone\u2019s message multiple times to figure\nout, \u201cIs he/she upset? Or am I too sensitive?\u201d Despite the difficulties,\nfiguring out emotion or sentiment in texts is crucial nowadays, due to\nour daily habit of using emails, mobile messengers, social media, chats.\nAn interesting question is, \u201ccan we teach machines to understand\nsentiment and emotions inside our texts?\u201d\n\nWe introduce how to build a sentiment/emotion analysis system by\ntraining deep learning models with a huge amount of tweets. We exploit\nthe emotional knowledge inside those texts by using emojis and hashtags\nas weakly supevised label. Our system ranked Top 3 in SemEval 2018:\nAffect in Tweets, a well-known competition in the NLP research\ncommunity.\n\nblog:\n`https://medium.com/park-ji-ho/teaching-machines-to-read-emotions-in-\ntexts-with-emojis-and-hashtags-\na50b7e93384f <https://medium.com/park-ji-%20ho/teaching-machines-to-read-emotions-in-texts-with-emojis-and-%20hashtags-%20a50b7e93384f>`__\n\npaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08280\n",
