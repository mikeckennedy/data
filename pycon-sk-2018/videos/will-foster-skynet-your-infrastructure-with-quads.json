  "description": "The very small 2-person DevOps team within Red Hat Performance/Scale\nEngineering has developed a set of Open Source Python-based systems and\nnetwork automation provisioning tools designed to end-to-end automate\nthe provisioning of large-scale systems and network switches using tools\nlike Foreman, Ansible, and other Open Source bits.\n\nQUADS \u2013 or \u201cquick and dirty scheduler\u201d allows a normally overburdened\nDevOps warrior to fully automate large swaths of systems and network\ndevices based on a schedule, even set systems provisioning to fire off\nin the future so they can focus on important things like Netflix and\npopcorn or not reading your emails while your datacenter burns in an\ninferno of rapid, automated skynet provisioning. QUADS will also\nauto-generate up-to-date infrastructure documentation, track scheduling,\nsystems assignments and more.\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll show you how we\u2019re using QUADS (backed by Foreman) to\nempower rapid, meaningful performance and scale testing of Red Hat\nproducts and technologies. While QUADS is a new project and under\nconstant development, the design approach to handling large-scale\nsystems provisioning as well as the current codebase is consumable for\nothers interested in improving the efficiency and level of automation\nwithin their infrastructure.\n\nWe'll also dive into purposeful development design choices, how some of\nthese choices might not scale for the future (but work well at present)\nand provide a future roadmap of a new redesign based on Flask, Celery,\nSqlite and friends.\n",
