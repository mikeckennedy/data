  "description": "Python can be deceptive - it looks so simple. Surely it will take only 5\nto 10 minutes to learn.\n\nSelf taught programmers often miss important fundamentals in Python -\nincluding:\n\n-  Everything is an Object. Yes everything. Integers, 'real' objects,\n   functions, classes. Ooooh template metaprogramming.\n-  It's only a name. Whoops. True, False, no longer None.\n-  'Objects can change their type'. Not.\n-  How the heck to a actually make a copy\n-  Which parts of tuples are constant?\n-  Deep and Shallow - weren't not talking philosophy here\n-  Accidental name creation - there's no easy solution\n-  Argument passing, Mutable arguments, default arguments, Mutable\n   default arguments\n-  Questions\n\n",
