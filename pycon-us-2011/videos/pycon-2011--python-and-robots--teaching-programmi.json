  "description": "Python and Robots: Teaching Programming in High School\n\nPresented by Vern Ceder\n\nCombining Python with inexpensive robots is a very effective way of\nteaching programming at the middle and high school levels. Since Python\nis easy to understand a constructivist approach is possible - students\nlearn by creating and running simple programs, observing the results,\nand then modifying their code to fix bugs and add functionality.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe approach suggested in this talk is partly based upon that developed\nat the Institute for Personal Robots in Education\n(`http://wiki.roboteducation.org <http://wiki.roboteducation.org/>`__)\nby staff from Georgia Tech and Bryn Mawr, combined with my own\nexperiences teaching programming with Python as described in my talk\n\"Goodbye, Hello World: Rethinking Teaching with Python\", PyCon 2007, and\nmy subsequent talks at NECC.\n\nBecause students are able to see what their code is doing and because\nPython is easy to understand, students can explore simple programming\nconcepts, learning features as they need them. This approach increases\nboth student engagement and retention. It also seems that this approach\nis more appealing to girls than a more traditional programming class.\n\nI'll illustrate my talk with samples of code created by students and\nvideo of the students/robots in action.\n\nOutline\n\nIntroduction - school background, course structure, origin of approach\n\nHardware and computer setup used\n\nInitial exercises and first projects\n\n-  Control of robot\n-  Program as sequence of commands\n-  Basic programming concepts - looping, branching, functions\n\nAdvanced projects\n\n::\n\n    * obstacle detection \n    * image processing \n    * simple AI approaches \n\nPitfalls and strategies for using robots\n\nQuestions and Suggestions\n",
