But what are the most efficient practices to work with Jupyter notebooks to get the most out of this technology? In this talk Dmitry Trofimov, team lead of PyCharm IDE, will show how different tools help you solve your daily tasks using Jupyter notebooks: JupyterLab, Hydrogen plugin for Atom, VS Code, and PyCharm (all tools are open-sourced).
