  "description": "Python has long been established in software development departments of\nresearch and industry, not least because of the proliferation of\nlibraries such as *SciPy* and *Matplotlib*. However, when processing\nlarge amounts of data, in particular in combination with GUI toolkits\n(*Qt*) or three-dimensional visualizations (*OpenGL*), it seems that\nPython as an interpretative programming language may be reaching its\nlimits.\n\n--------------\n\n*Outline*\n\n-  Introduction (1 min)\n\n   -  motivation\n\n-  GR framework (2 mins)\n\n   -  layer structure\n   -  output devices and capabilities\n\n-  GR3 framework (1 min)\n\n   -  layer structure\n   -  output capabilities (3 mins)\n\n      -  high-resolution images\n      -  POV-Ray scenes\n      -  OpenGL drawables\n      -  HTML5 / WebGL\n\n-  Simple 2D / 3D examples (2 min)\n-  Interoperability (PyQt/PySide, 3 min)\n-  How to speed up Python scripts (4 mins)\n\n   -  Numpy\n   -  Numba (Pro)\n\n-  Animated visualization examples (live demos, 6 mins)\n\n   -  physics simulations\n   -  surfaces / meshes\n   -  molecule viewer\n   -  MRI voxel data\n\n-  Outlook (1 min)\n\n*Notes*\n\nLinks to similar talks, tutorials or presentations can be found\n`here <http://gr-framework.org/>`__. Unfortunately, most of them are in\nGerman language.\n\nThe GR framework has already been presented in a talk at PyCon DE\n`2012 <https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/54>`__ and\n`2013 <https://2013.de.pycon.org/schedule/sessions/45/>`__, during a\n`poster\nsession <https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/158/>`__ at\nPyCon US 2013, and at `PythonCamps\n2013 <http://josefheinen.de/rasberry-pi.html>`__ in Cologne. The slides\nfor the PyCon.DE 2013 talk can be found\n`here <http://iffwww.iff.kfa-juelich.de/pub/doc/PyCon_DE_2013>`__.\n\nAs part of a collaboration the GR framework has been integrated into\n`NICOS <http://cdn.frm2.tum.de/fileadmin/stuff/services/ITServices/nicos-2.0/dirhtml/>`__\n(a network-based control system completely written in Python) as a\nreplacement for PyQwt.\n",

  "summary": "Python developers often get frustrated when managing visualization\npackages that cover the specific needs in scientific or engineering\nenvironments. The `*GR* framework <http://gr-framework.org/>`__ could\nhelp. *GR* is a library for visualization applications ranging from\npublication-quality 2D graphs to the creation of complex 3D scenes and\ncan easily be integrated into existing Python environments or\ndistributions like *Anaconda*.\n",
