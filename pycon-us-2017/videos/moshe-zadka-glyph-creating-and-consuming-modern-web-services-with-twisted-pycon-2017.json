  "description": "This tutorial will show students how to write applications and services\nwhich efficiently publish and consume services and APIs.\n\nTo do so, we will combine 4 Python-based technologies:\n\n-  Jupyter is a real-time development environment.\n-  Twisted is a powerful platform for network programming that supports\n   many protocols, including HTTP.\n-  Klein is a Twisted-based web application framework.\n-  Treq is a Requests-style HTTP client based on Twisted.\n\nBy combining all of these we will guide students through *interactively\nprototyping* a production quality web application that *publishes* both\n*service APIs* and web resources such as HTML, and that can *efficiently\nconsume many back-end services* such as 3rd-party APIs.\n",
