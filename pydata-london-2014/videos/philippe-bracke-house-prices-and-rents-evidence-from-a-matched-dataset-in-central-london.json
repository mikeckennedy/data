  "description": "The average ratio between house prices and rents is an indicator of\nhousing market conditions. Since micro data on rents are difficult to\nfind, little is known about this ratio at the individual-property level.\nIn this project, I analyse a real estate agency's proprietary dataset\ncontaining tens of thousands of rental transactions in Central London\nduring the 2006-2012 period. I merge it with the Land Registry and\nisolate 1,922 properties which were both sold and rented out within a\nsix-month period. I measure their price-rent ratios and show that\nprice-rent ratios are higher for bigger and more central units.\n",
