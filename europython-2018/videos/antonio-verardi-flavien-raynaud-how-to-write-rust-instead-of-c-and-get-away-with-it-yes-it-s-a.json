  "description": "Have you ever tried optimizing a super-slow Python application and\nthought: \u201cOh! I wish I could just write this bit it in Rust\u201d? Well,\nturns out you can! We will show you how Rust is a better alternative\nthan C to make your programs lightning fast, and how to get away with\nit; without your users even noticing.\n\nAs Infrastructure Engineers at Yelp, the challenge we face everyday is:\nscale. Yelp is mostly a Python shop and while this is great for\ndevelopment velocity, our work often revolves around making Python\napplications run faster. Until now, we have been using different\ntechniques: faster interpreters, or, more often, C code.\n\nGiven its safety guarantees, performance and promise of better tooling\nthan C, we decided we had to give Rust a try. The initial results helped\nreinforce that there was a lot of opportunity for Rust to play an\nimportant role in our production code.\n\nYelp heavily relies on the Apache Avro (https://avro.apache.org/)\nserialization format for its internal infrastructure. During the talk,\nwe will show how we implemented an Avro serialization/deserialization\nlibrary in Rust, how we were able to call it from Python (and in theory\nfrom any other language) with very little code, using tools such as\ncbindgen (https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen/), CFFI\n(https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and Milksnake\n(https://github.com/getsentry/milksnake/).\n\nThis talk would outline how easy it is to write performant code in a\nlanguage like Rust and call it from Python applications without users\neven realizing it, making this a great solution for production services.\n",
