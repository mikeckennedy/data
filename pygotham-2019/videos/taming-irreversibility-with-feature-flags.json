  "description": "It's been 10 years since Flickr\u2019s development team documented the use of\nFeature Flags in their software. Tech giants like Google and Facebook have\nalso stated their use, yet weirdly enough there seems to be only but few\naround the community benefitting from feature flipping.\n\nFlags make toggling whole features on and off without touching the code\npossible. This can help the development team not only by cutting down on\nresponse time to disasters but also by loading on peace of mind for\ndevelopers. There are also great improvements on code sync frequency and in\nthe launching flow of new features - especially in applications with a large\nsum of users.\n\nAlong with these great benefits, feature flags also raise some concerns:\nthere are multiple strategies to implement them and numerous new things to\nworry about when developing new gated features. From the tools you can use\nto store and retrieve your flags to the way you can maintain your\napplication\u2019s consistency in edge cases scenarios.\n\nThis talk focuses on some of the benefits and challenges faced when using\nfeature flags on team projects, and how to extract their best value without\nlosing sight of code quality.",
