  "description": "As data scientists we usually like to apply fancy machine learning\nmodels to well-groomed datasets. Everyone working on industrial problems\nwill eventually learn, that this does not reflect reality. The amount of\ntime spent on modeling is small compared to data gathering, -warehousing\nand -cleaning. Even after training and deployment of the model, the work\nis not done. Continuous monitoring of the performance and input data is\nstill necessary.\n\nIn this talk I discuss how important data handling is for successful\ndata science projects. Each milestone, from finding the business case to\ncontinuously monitoring the performance of the solution, is addressed.\nThis is exemplary shown on a project, with the goal of improving a\nproductive system.\n",
