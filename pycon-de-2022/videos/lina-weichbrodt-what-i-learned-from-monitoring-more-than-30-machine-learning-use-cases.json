    "description": "Speaker:: Lina Weichbrodt\n\nTrack: General: Production\nThis talk summarizes the most important insights I gained from running more than 30 machine learning use cases in production. We will take a loan prediction model as an example use case and cover questions like:\r\n\r\n- What is the difference between metrics for model training and metrics for model monitoring?\r\n- Which metrics are generally useful to be monitored?  \r\n- Which metrics should you prioritize?\r\n- How can monitoring be set up using a traditional software monitoring stack (tools like Grafana and Prometheus)?\r\n\r\nThis talk will be useful for you if you:\r\n- are a hands-on engineer or data scientist\r\n- want to use your team's or company's existing monitoring and dashboarding infrastructure to monitor machine learning stacks \r\n- are a beginner or intermediate in MLOPs\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/SEXPKA\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
