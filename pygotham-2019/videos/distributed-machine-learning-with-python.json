  "description": "As the amount of data continues to grow, the need for distributed machine\nlearning continues to grows with it. We'll discuss techniques and methods\nfor distributing machine learning training such as data parallelism and\nmodel parallelism. We'll then discuss how to build scalable machine learning\nsystems and show two examples of this using Python: one with Apache Spark\nMLlib, one with TensorFlow.",
