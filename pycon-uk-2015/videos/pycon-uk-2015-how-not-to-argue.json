  "description": "If you've spent any time in technology, you will have come across the\nclassic phenomenon of the unproductive technical debate -- and not just\nbikeshedding. Much of our technical debate seems to end up full of\ncognitive dissonance, ego, the cherry-picking of evidence, talking at\ncross purposes, and argument for its own sake.\n\nThis talk will attempt to diagnose the roots of this disfunction, and\nprovide some pointers towards how to engage in more constructive\ndialogue.\n\nKeywords: Torvalds, Socrates, Jonathan Haidt, Djangogirls, Cognitive\nBehavioural Therapy.",
