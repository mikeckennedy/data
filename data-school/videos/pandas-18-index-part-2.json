  "description": "In part two of our discussion of the index, we'll switch our focus from the DataFrame index to the Series index. After discussing index-based selection and sorting, I'll demonstrate how automatic index alignment during mathematical operations and concatenation enables us to easily work with incomplete data in pandas.\n\nThis is video 18 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
