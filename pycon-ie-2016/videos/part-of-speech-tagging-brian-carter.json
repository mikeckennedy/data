  "description": "Up until quite recently the main go to part-of-speech tagger (POS) for\nuse in Python was the NLTK Tagger using the default Penn Treebank\ntagger. Another popular option was from the Stanford Log-Linear\nPart-Of-Speech Tagger from Stanford CoreNLP.\n\nIn May 2016 Google open sourced SyntaxNet with the humorously named\nEnglish parser Parsey McParseFace. Another commercial\ncompany `Spacy.io <http://spacy.io/>`_ also provides an open source\nparser.\n\nThe development of Part-Of-Speech tagging continues in academia, but\nmost are not at the stage where they can be easily used outside of\nresearch. How do these taggers differ? This talk will give an overview\nof part-of-speech tagging from a practical implementation/use-case\npoint of view.\n\n-  What is part-of-speech tagging\n-  Real life performance on datasets\n-  How you might use POS in a project\n-  Compare and contrast the above mentioned taggers for performance.\n",
