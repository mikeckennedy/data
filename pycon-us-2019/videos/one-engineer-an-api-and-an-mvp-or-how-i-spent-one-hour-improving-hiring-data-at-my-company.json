Read on to hear how! </announcer>\n\nOne challenge in improving diversity within a hiring pipeline is the\nstruggle to measure what exists in the first place. It's hard to know\nwhere to focus your resources until you know what you have to work with,\nand can identify what steps make a difference and what efforts don't.\nUsing python/django and an api key for our recruiting vendor, you can\nmake this information visible and, therefore, actionable, with very\nlittle work.\n",
