  "description": "ADTK is an open-source Python package for unsupervised/rule-based time series anomaly detection. It provides a unified API for common building blocks of anomaly detection models, several auxiliary tools, and includes easy access to scikit-learn models. In this talk, we will present how a data scientist may use ADTK to build a practical anomaly detection model on time-series IoT data.",
