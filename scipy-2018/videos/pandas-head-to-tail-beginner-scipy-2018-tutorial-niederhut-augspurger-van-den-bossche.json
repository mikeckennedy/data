  "description": "This tutorial is an introduction to pandas, a library providing data\nstructures and algorithms for tabular data analysis. It's aimed at\nscientists and data analysts new to scientific Python. No previous\nexperience with pandas is expected. Familiarity with the basics of\nPython will be helpful. We'll work through a series of Jupyter notebooks\ntogether, with an emphasis on solving realistic problems as exercises.\nWe'll cover 1. A definition of tabular data and pandas' data structures\nfor tabular data 2. How pandas' alignment by row and column labels\nsimplifies data analysis 3. groupby for analyzing subsets of a table\ngrouped by some common factor 4. Tidy data: how to structure your data\nto facilitate analysis. 5. Performance: How to benchmark and profile\ncode, and some common pandas performance pitfalls 6. pandas' special\nsupport for time-series data.Presenter(s): Speaker: Dillon Niederhut,\nEnthought Speaker: Tom Augspurger, Anaconda, Inc. Speaker: Joris Van den\nBossche, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science\n",
