  "description": "Just as we find more and more \"things\" on the internet, so do we find more and more options for messaging. What are they? How do they compare? And which should I use?\n\nMQTT is being used by AWS but how does this compare to the newly emerging gRPC; how does the tried and tested Avro compare to Protocol Buffers or even using the familiar JSON with HTTP and Websockets?\n\nThis talk aims to provide an subjective comparison of serialisation and communication formats that can be used with IoT devices with a focus on performance.",
