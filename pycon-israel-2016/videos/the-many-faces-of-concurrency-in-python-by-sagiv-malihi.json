  "description": "I'll talk about the many ways to achieve concurrency in Python, including multi-threading, multi-processing, gevent, and maybe even asyncio / python 3.5's async-await. The talk will include examples from our experience developing a scale-out system for managing huge cellular networks in pure python.\n\nSlides available here:\nhttp://il.pycon.org/2016/static/sessions/sagiv-malihi.pdf\nand here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OM3UkcwZIjESw9M4peTLRYxc327vHS2F9P_LCdAZ78g/edit?usp=sharing",
