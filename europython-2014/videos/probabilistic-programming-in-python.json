  "description": "Probabilistic Programming allows flexible specification of statistical\nmodels to gain insight from data. Estimation of best fitting parameter\nvalues, as well as uncertainty in these estimations, can be automated by\nsampling algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The high\ninterpretability and flexibility of this approach has lead to a huge\nparadigm shift in scientific fields ranging from Cognitive Science to\nData Science and Quantitative Finance.\n\nPyMC3 is a new Python module that features next generation sampling\nalgorithms and an intuitive model specification syntax. The whole code\nbase is written in pure Python and Just-in-time compiled via Theano for\nspeed.\n\nIn this talk I will provide an intuitive introduction to Bayesian\nstatistics and how probabilistic models can be specified and estimated\nusing PyMC3.\n",
