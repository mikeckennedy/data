  "description": "Your software is too slow, and you need to figure out why. It's natural to\nreach for the cProfile profiler that's built-in to Python, but as a\ndeterministic profiler it suffers from a number of limitations.\n\nIn this talk you'll learn about better tools for performance optimization:\n\n* Sampling profilers, which distort the results less and give you a calltree\n  overview of your running application.\n* Trace-based logging, which can help you figure out not only which\n  functions are slow, but also which particular inputs are causing the\n  slowness.",
