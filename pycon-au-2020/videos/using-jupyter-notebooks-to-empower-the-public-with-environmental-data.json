The Notebooks we\u2019ve created serve to empower interested members of the public in participatory learning about industry-related pollution that is meaningful to them and their networks, as well as creating strategic, compelling, and informative reports of environmental injustices to inform community action. Our goal is to create a future in which justice and equity are at the center of environmental, climate, and data governance. \r\nNo environmental justice knowledge required to attend.\r\n\r\nAuthors: Maalvika Bhat, Kelsey Breseman, Steve Hansen, Gil Jang, Eric Nost, Chris Sellers, Paul St. Denis, Lourdes Vera, Sara Wylie, and EDGI\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 16:35:00 2020 at Floperator",
