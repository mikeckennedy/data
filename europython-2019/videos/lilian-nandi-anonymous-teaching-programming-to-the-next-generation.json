  "description": "Our generation of young people in school (aged 5-18) have noticed the\nconnection between Computer pRogramming, Technology & Success and\nBillionaires.On mass they are clamoring to master the skill of Computer\npRogramming. We describe a successful working model for the teaching of\nComputer pRogamming.\n\nComputer Science is now regarded as one of the leading disciplines in\nthe 21st century. Computers are ubiquitous and prevalent in most, if not\nall, sectors of our modern society \u2013 applications include using them in\nweather forecasting, robotic surgery, space exploration, e-commerce,\nsmart cities, driverless cars, etc.\n\nTherefore, coding or computer programming is now regarded by many as an\nessential skill for the young person, and it has been dubbed the \u20184th\u2019\nR\u2019 (computer pRogramming) along with Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic.\n\nIn recognition of the new status of computer programming, governments\nworldwide have launched initiatives to have it taught in schools from\nKindergarten through to junior school and all the way through secondary\nschool.\n\nSo, the question emerges is how do we best teach and motivate the next\ngeneration in acquiring this skill? Given the fact that this field is\nvery much in its infancy, there are insufficient number of skilled\nComputer Science teachers and very little pedagogy to guide the\neducator. Therefore, the whole world is learning how best to teach this\nsubject by trial and error.\n\nThe talk will describe a case study whereby coding/computer programming,\nin the form of Python programming, was introduced to a group of 110\nyoung people from the ages of 11 to 18 (Years 7-13 in a U.K secondary\nschool). The talk will include descriptions of the various teaching\nmethodologies introduced to the young people for this purpose and the\noutcomes; the talk will also address various challenges and questions\nabout how to teach coding to young people. The talk will conclude with\nhelpful suggestions, based on the findings of the case study, on how to\nproceed with the teaching of computer programming to these people.",
