  "description": "The Django documentation section on testing starts with this: \u201cAutomated testing is an extremely useful bug-killing tool for the modern Web developer.\u201d Nobody can argue with that. Testing is an integral part of modern software development, and Ana\u2019s talk will offer an in-depth overview of how the Django testing framework evolved; showcase some common techniques, tools, and best practices; talk about speed improvements; and guide you through a real-world example of testing a Django app. Testing is fun, isn\u2019t it? Previously presented at Django Under the Hood and keynoted recently at DjangoCon US. See video and slides: http://ana-balica.github.io/talks/",
