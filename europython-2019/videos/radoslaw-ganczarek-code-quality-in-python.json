  "description": "| Four years ago I talked about code quality during EuroPython in\n  Bilbao. A lot of things changed from that time. Firstly, most tools I\n  presented were still developed and gained new features, but also new\n  ones appeared I wanted to discuss with you. Secondly, Python changed,\n  Python 3 has type hints on board and there is a new tool dedicated to\n  checking the types. Thirdly - I changed. I'm more distanced form my\n  zealous approach from four years ago. I got real and reasonable.\n  That's why I wanted to talk about code quality tools in Python again.\n| I'll talk about all the software that can make code review a bit\n  simpler by pointing out possible errors, duplicates or unused code.\n  I'll talk again about formatters and how can they be used in\n  modern-time projects. And I'll talk about hobgoblins, if you know what\n  I mean :)",
