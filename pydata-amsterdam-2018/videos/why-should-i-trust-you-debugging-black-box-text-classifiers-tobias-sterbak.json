  "description": "Classifying text is a common use case for machine learning algorithms. But despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction. We will use eli5 and the LIME algorithm to explain text classifiers.",
