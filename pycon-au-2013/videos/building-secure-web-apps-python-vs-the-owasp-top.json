  "summary": "The web is a scary place, and building secure web applications is\ndifficult. Luckily, you've got Python! The Python web community tends to\ntake security seriously, so most popular Python web frameworks have\ndefenses available. This talk looks at the list of the top 10 security\nvulnerabilities, as ranked by The Open Web Application Security Project\n(OWASP). We'll talk about what each attack is, and look at how to defend\nagainst them using three popular Python web frameworks -- Django,\nPyramid, and Flask.\n",
