  "description": "\"Tabular data\" is just data that has been formatted as a table, with rows and columns (like a spreadsheet). You can easily read a tabular data file into pandas, even directly from a URL! In this video, I'll walk you through how to do that, including how to modify some of the default arguments of the read_table function to solve common problems.\n\nThis is video 2 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
