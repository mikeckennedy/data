  "description": "With ever-increasing advancements in technology, neuroscientists are\nable to collect data in greater volumes and with finer resolution. There\nhas been a growing interest in leveraging this vast volume of data\nacross levels of analysis, measurement techniques, and experimental\nparadigms to gain more insight into brain function. At multiple stages\nand levels of neuroscience investigation, ML holds great promise as an\naddition to the arsenal of analysis tools for discovering how the brain\nworks. As quantitative analysis of brain MRI is routine for many\nneurological diseases and conditions, deep learning-based segmentation\napproaches for brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are gaining\ninterest due to their self-learning and generalisation ability over\nlarge amounts of data. On the other hand, High Performance Computing\n(HPC) and AI will increasingly intertwine as we transition to an\nexascale future using new computing, storage, and communications\ntechnologies. In this talk I will walk you through fundamentals of\ngenerating high- performance deep-learning models in TensorFlow platform\nusing Python on large computing system (e.g NVIDIA\u00ae Tesla\u00ae GPUs powered\nby Tensor Cores), in order to infer and segment thousands of cell\ncentroids out of the brain objects of interest. From a more\ntechnological perspective, although astonishing results have been\nachieved concerning the distribution of training large convolutional\nneural networks on big data, to date the Python scientific ecosystem is\nstill missing tools for an optimised and, above all, distributed\ninference of deep learning models. In this talk I will show you how a\ntiling-based inferencing approach could be a good solution to remedy the\nproblem. The talk is intended for intermediate PyData researchers and\npractitioners. Basic to intermediate level experience in image\nrecognition/object detection deep learning applications is assumed.\nOverall, a good proficiency with the Python language and with scientific\npython libraries (e.g. numpy, TensorFlow, Keras) are required for the\nentire talk.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1794\n\nin \\_\\_on **Sunday 5 May** at 11:00 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
