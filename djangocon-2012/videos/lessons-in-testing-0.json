  "description": "Testing can be one of the more difficult concepts to pick up in a\ndevelopment cycle. With the complexities of large projects, and even\nsmall projects, writing effective, automated tests can take many times\nlonger than writing the code and testing it by hand.\n\nThis talk will explore the various patterns of testing that DISQUS has\nimplemented, and iterated upon over the last two years. It will describe\nhow testing has been used to speed up the product lifecycle, improve\nstability through automation, and the culture shift required to get\nthere. Most importantly, it will cover the practices that have been put\nin place that have helped ease the burden of writing tests.\n",
