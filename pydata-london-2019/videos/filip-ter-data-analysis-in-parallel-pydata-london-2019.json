  "description": "This tutorial will demonstrate how to efficiently use IPyParallel, to benefit from parallelism in the early stages of data analysis and model development. The aim is to demystify parallelism for analysts and researchers, so that they can start using it early on in their workflow. Examples of common tasks will be shown in Jupyter, and how they can be easily run in parallel without major disruption.",
