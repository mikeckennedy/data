  "description": "About the lecture: PyPy is just a python interpreter. One of the original goals of the project were to make existing python programs run faster, and PyPy succeeded in that. However, the even more exciting part is that optimizations implemented in PyPy let people do things in Python that were not possible before, like real-time video processing, numeric array manipulation faster than in C etc. etc. During the talk I'll present some demos and talk what things are possible having a decent optimizing just-in-time compiler and briefly discuss strategies that we used for achieving this. I'll also discuss how faster-than-C, pypy's original goal from years ago, is after all not that far off.The Conference was in Jun\u00edn ( Buenos Aires, Argentina ) September 2011. The event was managed by PyAr ( Argentinian Python Group ).",
