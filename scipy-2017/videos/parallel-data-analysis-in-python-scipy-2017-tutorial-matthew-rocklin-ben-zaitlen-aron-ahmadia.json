It focuses on covering a few programming techniques rather than diving into one framework or tool in particular.     \n\nStudent Goals:\n\nStudents will walk away with a high-level understanding of both parallel problems and how to reason about parallel computing frameworks. They will also walk away with hands-on experience using a variety of frameworks easily accessible from Python.",
