  "description": "One of Python's main advantages has always been its ability to expose external libraries to Python code very easily, however, writing wrappers around these libraries has always been a pain point that CFFI aims to address. CFFI allows you to call code written in other programming languages without having to write anything other than Python code, it is famous for being able to call C code but is also able to call code written in other languages like Rust and Go. This talk will go over the advantages of using CFFI as opposed to the other ways of calling external libraries in Python (such as writing C extensions) and showcase more advanced ways of using CFFI to improve PyPy's compatibility with Python modules.",
