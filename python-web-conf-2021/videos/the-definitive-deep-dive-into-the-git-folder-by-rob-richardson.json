  "description": "\"The Definitive Deep Dive into the .git Folder\" by: Rob Richardson\n\nWhat\u2019s in the .git folder? How are commits stored? How do branches work? We\u2019ll dive deep into the objects folder, unpack commits, look at the types of DAG nodes, examine object content, and build a complete visualization of the stored content. We\u2019ll also quickly look through Git hooks, Git config, and ref logs. Come experience the zen of git.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
