  "description": "While developing software, bugs and mistakes are inevitable. Come to hear\nhow we can improve the approaches we often take as software developers to\nwork better with one another in heated moments of failure and the aftermath\nof incidents. Through better interactions we can build better teams and\ncreate better services.\n\nIn my career I have worked in a blameless post-mortem and a blame-full post\nmortem environment, across a variety of projects ranging from individual\npython libraries, to core infrastructure for a cloud. I am excited to share\nhow I think not assigning blame when things go wrong results in a better\nteam and a better product.",
