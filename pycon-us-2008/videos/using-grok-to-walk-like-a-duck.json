  "description": "Web development often involves bringing together many different components to build a single site. Authentication, social networking, media management, and content management are examples of the kind of features that are often powered by third-party modules or extensions. This talk introduces Zope's adapter registry and how a declarative web framework like Grok lets you use the “Adapter” gang-of-four design pattern to link components together into a cleanly functioning site.",
