  "description": "When your Python needs to be fast, one powerful tool is the ability to write\ncompiled extension modules. Normally this is done using the C API, but that\nrequires managing reference counts and memory allocation and is nearly\nimpossible to do *correctly* for non-trivial programs. In this talk, we'll\nlook at how you can write extension modules in Rust - a memory-safe systems\nprogramming language that is increasingly popular as a replacement for C and\nC++, and the [most loved language in the Stack Overflow developer survey 4\nyears running](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-\nmost-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages).\n\nThis talk will focus on `pyo3` and `milksnake`, two popular libraries that\nprovide very different approaches for writing Rust extensions; it will cover\na basic introduction to the libraries, and compare their relative strengths\nand weaknesses. These will also be compared to C and Cython extension\nmodules from a performance, safety and maintainability perspective.",
