  "description": "A few months ago we decided to upgrade our CI to include integration tests beyond the usual unit tests for our DNA synthesis and ordering platform. Rather than mocking our complex microservices environment, we chose to use VCR to record and replay the interactions. We will discuss the pros & cons of using PyVCR with examples and a walk through on how to use it.",
