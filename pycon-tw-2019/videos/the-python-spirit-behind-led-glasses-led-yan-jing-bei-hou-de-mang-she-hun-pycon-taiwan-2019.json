  "description": "Day 1, R0 10:50\u201311:20\n\nIn 2017, the music band \"21 Band\" got some fascinating LED glasses that look very good on stage. Besides the built-in pattern from the glasses, we also hacked into them and made some changes. The glasses are connected to a computer, and so is the keyboard. A program is written to detect different notes or chords, and triggers different LED patterns. In this talk we will share how it is achieved, the problem that we encountered, improvements that we made, and talk about some future works.\r\n\r\n2017 \u5e74\uff0c21 \u6a02\u5718\u56e0\u7de3\u969b\u6703\u7372\u5f97\u4e86\u821e\u53f0\u6548\u679c\u5341\u8db3\u7684 LED \u773c\u93e1\u3002\u9664\u4e86 LED \u773c\u93e1\u5167\u5efa\u7684 pattern \u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u66f4\u6539\u88dd\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c\u8b93\u773c\u93e1\u53ef\u4ee5\u548c\u9375\u76e4\u624b\u7684\u9375\u76e4\u4e32\u63a5\uff0c\u900f\u904e\u4e00\u500b\u5075\u6e2c\u7a0b\u5f0f\u4f86\u555f\u52d5\u3001\u7d50\u675f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684 pattern\u3002\u672c\u6f14\u8b1b\u5c07\u548c\u5404\u4f4d\u5206\u4eab\u9019\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u9054\u6210\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u78b0\u5230\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3001\u9694\u5e74\u7684\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u5c55\u671b\u3002\n\nSlides: https://github.com/yychen/livespring\n\nSpeaker: Chiung-ting Chen\n\nPython \u611b\u597d\u8005\uff0c\u5e73\u5e38\u591a\u4f7f\u7528 Django \u6216 Tornado \u958b\u767c\u5404\u5f0f\u5404\u6a23\u5c08\u6848",
