  "description": "The humanities \u2014 fields like history, literature, and philosophy \u2014 are not\noften incorporated into our thought processes in the tech industry. However,\nbringing humanities contexts into our everyday work can strengthen the\nsoftware we build and ensure that it is serving our communities. Learn about\nhow creating software for humanities researchers has developed better Python\nprogrammers at MIT, and how our own self-learning can benefit from tackling\nprojects with humanistic values at their core.\n\nThis talk will provide you with an overview of how Python has been used to\nhelp solve humanities research problems, while also demonstrating how\nincorporating the humanities into Python development processes can improve\nsoftware. We will go over what things you should consider to think in more\ninterdisciplinary ways, and how broader contexts can ensure that the\nsoftware we build serves its users well.",
