  "description": "Knowing your enemies is as important as knowing your friends.\nUnderstanding your debugger is a little of both. Have you ever wondered\nhow Python debugging looks on the inside? On our journey to building a\nPython debugger, we learned a lot about its internals, quirks and more.\n\nDuring this session, we\u2019ll share how debugging actually works in Python.\nWe\u2019ll discuss the differences between CPython and PyPy interpreters,\nexplain the underlying debugging mechanism and show you how to utilize\nthis knowledge at work and up your watercooler talk game.\n",
