  "abstract": "Stochastic Solutions is producing a course on Anomaly Detection in\nPython for DataCamp. This workshop will give a preview of part of that\ncourse. Topics covered will include characterizing normality and\nabnormality, spotting anomalies by eye, building automated anomaly\ndetectors over various kinds of data streams and types, and\nconsiderations for monitoring (false positives vs. false negatives).\n\nThe workshop will include a number of exercises over sample data streams\nand will use a mixture of pure python, standard parts of the Scientific\nPython stack (numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc.), as well as the TDDA\nlibrary.\n\nNo special knowledge will be assumed, but some familiary with the Python\nScientific stack would be an advantage.\n",
