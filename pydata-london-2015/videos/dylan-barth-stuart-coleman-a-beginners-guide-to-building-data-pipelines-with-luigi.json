This involves\ntracking numerous unstructured data points from multiple sources in a\nvariety of formats and transforming them into a standardised feature set\nwe can use for building predictive models for our clients.\n\nIn the past, this data was collected by in a somewhat haphazard fashion:\ncombining manual effort, ad hoc scripting and processing which was\ndifficult to maintain. In order to streamline the data flows, we\u2019re\nusing an open-source Python framework from Spotify called Luigi. Luigi\nwas created for managing task dependencies, monitoring the progress of\nthe data pipeline and providing frameworks for common batch processing\ntasks.\n",
