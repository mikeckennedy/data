  "description": "A new subject for spring semester 2017 was prepared at Masaryk\nUniversity: Python for physicists. The goal of the subject was not\neasy at all. Effective scientific data processing using Python for\nanyone without any prior knowledge of the language.\n\nFundamentals of scientific Python (numpy, scipy, pandas) and graphics\n(matplotlib) introduced using simple real-word examples such as: line\nregression, bifurcation method, particle tracing in electromagnetic\nfields, fourier analysis of plasma voltage response, linear algebra\nusing numpy and introduction to machine learning. All accompanied\nwith introduction of concepts such as: basic data structures, reading\ndata from file, introduction to functions, modules and classes.\n\nThe subject was prepared as a collective work of 8 people. Not\neverything went exactly as was planned. Do you want to hear lessons\nwe all (students and teachers) have learnt?\n\n-----\n\nPetr Zik\u00e1n is a PhD student of Plasma physics at Masaryk University\nin Brno.\n\nAmong his main interests are numerical modeling of various physical\nsystems, data processing and data mining.\n\nHe works for Gauss Algorithmic as a data analyst and he is also a\nco-founder of PlasmaSolve company, where his main expertise lies in\nthe field of particle plasma modelling.",
