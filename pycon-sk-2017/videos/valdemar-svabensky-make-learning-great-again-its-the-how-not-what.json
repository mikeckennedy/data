  "description": "Are you curious about how to teach programming effectively? Are you a Python fan interested in everything Python-related? Or would you simply like to see a non-standard presentation? If you answered yes at least once, then this funny and inspiring talk is right for you! In around 20 minutes, you'll hear from a young student-teacher about:\n- What coding skills are taught to beginners and how\n- Experience with teaching\n- A few surprises\nNo technical knowledge is needed (some code samples will be shown, but they're not essential). Discussion at the end is very welcome. Looking forward to seeing you!",
