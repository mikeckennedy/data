  "description": "Cosmology is the study of the Universe, its evolution and forms of\nenergy within it. The Planck satellite has been able to detect light\nfrom the early stages of the Universe, 13 billion years ago,\nconfirming the scientific puzzle of Dark Energy and providing us with\na big data challenge. I will describe the context and how python is\nused for the analysis.\n",
