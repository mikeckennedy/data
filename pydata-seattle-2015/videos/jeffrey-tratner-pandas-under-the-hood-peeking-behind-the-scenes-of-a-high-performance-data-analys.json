  "description": "This talk will give a broad, accessible overview of pandas\u2019 internal structure and help explain how pandas works behind the scenes, including the libraries it relies on, its internal data structures (NDFrame, BlockManager, Index, etc), and how they all tie together to provide a flexible and performant API. I\u2019ll also explore how you can use this background to build up a better intuition about how to use pandas effectively.\n\nMaterials available here:\nInteractive slides: http://bit.ly/1M5ISBn\nPDF slides: http://bit.ly/1hkGJGu",
