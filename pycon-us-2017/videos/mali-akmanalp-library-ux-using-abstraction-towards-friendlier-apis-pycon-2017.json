  "description": "Complicated libraries can be a pain in the butt to use. It's not\nsurprising that there are a lot of \"X for humans\" libraries out there,\nsome of which are mostly wrappers around more frustrating interfaces.\n\nThis is not a theoretical talk. I'll touch upon theory to give you\ncontext, but will then talk about what that means for you in practice so\nthat you can write better libraries. I'll talk about why library UX\nmatters, about abstraction as a general concept, about out what happens\nwhen you over/under abstract, and about some useful tips to help build\nfriendly APIs. Meanwhile, I'll show some positive examples from\nlibraries we know and love (flask, SQLAlchemy, Requests, etc). Once you\nrecognize these effects in play, you'll be able to apply them to your\nown code and make life better for everyone!\n",
