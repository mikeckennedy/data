  "description": "Nexmo recently decided to refactor our Python client library to be\nPython 3-only. Learn why we made this decision, the advantages (and\ndisadvantages) that come along with it, and how we\u2019re monitoring and\nhelping our users with the migration.\n\nSince Python 3.4, Python has jumped forward, adding many features that\nare not available in Python 2.7. Maintaining Python 2 compatibility\nmeans either avoiding these new language features or using backport\nlibraries that provide an approximation. Neither provided the best\nexperience for our users.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll also discuss how we support users of our legacy\nlibrary, the benefits that the new library offers, and our experience of\ndeveloping a customer-facing Python library with the latest Python\nlanguage and core library.\n\nin \\_\\_on **venerd\u00ec 20 aprile** at 12:30 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
