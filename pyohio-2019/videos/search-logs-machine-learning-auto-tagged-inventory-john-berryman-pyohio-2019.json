  "description": "Eventbrite is exploring a new machine learning approach that allows us\nto harvest data from customer search logs and automatically tag events\nbased upon their content. The results have allowed us to provide users\nwith a better inventory browsing experience.\n\nFor e-commerce applications, matching users with the items they want is\nthe name of the game. If they can't find what they want then how can\nthey buy anything?! Typically this functionality is provided through\nsearch and browse experience. Search allows users to type in text and\nmatch against the text of the items in the inventory. Browse allows\nusers to select filters and slice- and-dice the inventory down to the\nsubset they are interested in. But with the shift toward mobile devices,\nno one wants to type anymore - thus browse is becoming dominant in the\ne-commerce experience.\n\nBut there's a problem! What if your inventory is not categorized?\nPerhaps your inventory is user generated or generated by external\nproviders who don't tag and categorize the inventory. No categories and\nno tags means no browse experience and missed sales. You could hire an\narmy of taxonomists and curators to tag items - but training and\ncuration will be expensive. You can demand that your providers tag their\nitems and adhere to your taxonomy - but providers will buck this new\nrequirement unless they see obvious and immediate benefit. Worse,\nproviders might use tags to game the system - artificially placing\nthemselves in the wrong category to drive more sales. Worst of all,\ncreating the right taxonomy is hard. You have to structure a taxonomy to\nrealistically represent how your customers think about the inventory.\n\nEventbrite is investigating a tantalizing alternative: using a\ncombination of customer interactions and machine learning to\nautomatically tag and categorize our inventory. As customers interact\nwith our platform - as they search for events and click on and purchase\nevents that interest them - we implicitly gather information about how\nour users think about our inventory. Search text effectively acts like a\ntag and a click on an event card is a vote for that clicked event is\nrepresentative of that tag. We are able to use this stream of\ninformation as training data for a machine learning classification\nmodel; and as we receive new inventory, we can automatically tag it with\nthe text that customers will likely use when searching for it. This\nmakes it possible to better understand our inventory, our supply and\ndemand, and most importantly this allows us to build the browse\nexperience that customers demand.\n\nIn this talk I will explain in depth the problem space and Eventbrite's\napproach in solving the problem. I will describe how we gathered\ntraining data from our search and click logs, and how we built and\nrefined the model. I will present the output of the model and discuss\nboth the positive results of our work as well as the work left to be\ndone. Those attending this talk will leave with some new ideas to take\nback to their own business.\n",
