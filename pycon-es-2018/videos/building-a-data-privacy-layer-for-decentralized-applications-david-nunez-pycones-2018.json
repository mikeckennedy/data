  "description": "In this talk, we'll go through our project called NuCypher, a network to empower privacy and data confidentiality in decentralized systems based on the use of advanced cryptographic techniques. In particular, we use \"proxy re-encryption\", a special type of cryptosystem that allows to delegate decryption rights of encrypted information. Nodes in our network provide a cryptographically-enforced access control service that allows users to securely share information with others, but in such a way that nodes are completely oblivious to the data that is encrypted: at no point nodes can read anything.\n\nWe'll cover how Python has enabled the vast majority of our implementation, from constructing a low-level library for elliptic curve arithmetic on top of cryptography.io, to interacting with the Ethereum blockchain with py-geth and web3.py. Finally, you'll see a practical example of the use of pyUmbral, our cryptographic library (https://github.com/nucypher/pyUmbral), and a live demo of how to share data securely with the NuCypher network.\n",
