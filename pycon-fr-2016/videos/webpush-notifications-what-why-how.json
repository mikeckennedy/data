  "description": "We all might know what push notifications are, having been a popular feature of mobile platforms for years. However, it is a recent adoption in the web platform and the features are constantly evolving. By the end of this talk, we\u2019ll have an understanding of what real-time web push notifications are, how do they work, and how can we make the best use of it, including news features like payload encryption and ttl headers.\nWeb push is a permission based technology that notifies a user of new messages or events even when they\u2019re not actively using the application. Push notifications are a hit among all the social media websites, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. Besides that, they are also very popular in cloud based data management, e-commerce websites, e-mail services, sports and auctions, and the list could go on. In this talk, we\u2019ll see a little behind-the-scences working of this technology, starting from the handling the user\u2019s subscription by the Push API, generating a push message when some action is triggered, to handling of the message by the Service Worker API, and finally dealing with the notification display using the Notification API.\n",
