  "description": "Machine Learning is probably the most important development in our\nindustry (and possibly our civilisation!). Previously restricted to math\ngeniuses with access to supercomputers and massive data centres, machine\nlearning tools are increasingly available as web services which are\neasily consumed from more traditional web applications. Python has\nbecome the lingua franca of machine learning, so Django developers are\nwell placed to take advantage of the next wave of application\ndevelopment.\n\nIn this talk I\u2019ll outline the various machine learning platforms and\nprovide a set of practical examples that demonstrate how Django\ndevelopers can start taking advantage of artificial intelligence in\ntheir own applications. These will include:\n\n-  Image recognition - using Microsoft Azure Vision to automatically\n   caption and label the images your users upload\n-  Entity analysis - using the Google Cloud Natural Language API to tag\n   news articles with people, locations and events\n-  Predictions - using Amazon Machine Learning to build a \u2018you may also\n   like\u2019 feature\n-  Sentiment analysis - using IBM Watson to understand the tone of\n   comments submitted to your site\n",
