  "description": "Have you ever wanted or perhaps needed to access data stored in a\ncorporate Oracle database from within your Python environment?\n\nThis session will help developers get up and running using Python with\nOracle:\n\n- Learn the basics of working with cx\\_Oracle\n- Learn how to use VirtualBox to set up a Python & Oracle test and developement environment. \n- Discover features within Oracle that you can use to build more performant python based applications. \n- Leave with all the resources you need to certify your python app to run against a production Oracle11gR2 database, or hone those skills for the next job.\n- Get a quick intro to Oracle Linux along the way.\n\nNo prior experience with Oracle is required, some basic understanding of\ndatabases would be helpful.\n\nLook forward to meeting you @ EuroPython 2011 - Todd\n",
