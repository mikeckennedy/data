    "description": "Speaker:: Vaggelis Papoutsellis Dr. Jakob Sauer J\u00f8rgensen\n\nTrack: PyData: PyData & Scientific Libraries Stack\nIn this talk, we present the [Core Imaging Library (CIL)](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL), an open-source, object-oriented Python library for solving large scale imaging inverse problems. We give a brief introduction on inverse problems with motivating examples in different imaging applications such as denoising, deblurring and inpainting. Then, we present the optimisation framework of CIL, that is used to formalise and solve these problems with a wide range of CIL operators, functions and algorithms. Finally, we will demonstrate how to use CIL to reconstruct a real and challenging tomographic dataset with conventional analytic methods and iterative reconstruction algorithms\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/GSLJUY\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
