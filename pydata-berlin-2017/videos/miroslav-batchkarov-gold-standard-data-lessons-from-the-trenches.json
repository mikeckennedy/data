  "description": "The first stage in a data science project is often to collect training data. However, getting a good data set is surprisingly tricky and takes longer than one expects. This talk describes our experiences in labelling gold-standard data and the lessons we learnt the hard way. We will present three case studies from natural language processing and discuss the challenges we encountered.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nIt is often said that rather than spending a month figuring out how to apply unsupervised learning to a problem domain, a data scientist should spend a week labelling data. However, the difficulty of annotating data is often underestimated. Gathering a sufficiently large collection of good-quality labelled data requires careful problem definition and multiple iterations. In this talk, I will describe three case studies and lessons learnt from them. Each case shows several aspect of the process that should be considered in advance to ensure the project is successful.\n\n",
