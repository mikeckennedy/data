  "description": "Language composition allows us to write programs in a mixture of\ndifferent languages. This sounds ideal since it should allow us to\nchoose the best mix of languages for the task at hand. Due to technical\nhurdles however, language compositions tend to be little more than\nsimple foreign function interfaces (FFIs).\n\nAt King's college London we are trying to build better language\ncompositions. We have devised a new approach which makes it much easier\nto intermingle programming languages without compromising performance.\nIn this talk I will outline our approach and show what happens when you\nput Python and PHP in a blender.",
