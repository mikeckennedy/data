  "description": "Are code reviews a source of tension on your team? Do they lead to\nconflict, bikeshedding, or wasted time?\n\nMost of the discussion we hear about code reviews is technical. We focus\nmyopically on minimizing cost and maximizing bug discoveries. But reviews\nare as much a social exercise as a technical one. They\u2019re an opportunity for\nteammates to share knowledge and bond through collaboration. That can\u2019t\nhappen if people are strangling each other over where to place the curly\nbraces.\n\nIn this talk, you\u2019ll learn practical techniques your team can use to improve\ncommunication and minimize conflict during code reviews. I\u2019ll talk about:\n\n* Reducing human effort of reviews through automation\n* Increasing your team\u2019s review velocity\n* Giving sincere praise\n* Framing discussions for constructive debate\n* Mitigating stalemates",
