  "description": "Classification algorithms tend to perform poorly when data is skewed\ntowards one class. Real-world examples include fraud detection, medical\ndiagnosis and oil spill detection, where the class of interest is\ngenerally the minority class. A key assumption built into many\nclassification algorithms is that maximising accuracy is the goal;\nhowever, when positive instances account for only 1% of the data set in\nquestion, an accuracy of 99% doesn\u2019t quite cut it.\n\nA common practice to address the problem with imbalanced data sets is to\nrebalance them artificially using a range of sampling techniques.\nHowever, one-class learning and cost-sensitive learning algorithms are\ngrowing in popularity. This talk looks at different approaches to\ntackling the problem of imbalanced classes in the context of fraud\ndetection, as have recently been explored by the GoCardless data team.\n",
