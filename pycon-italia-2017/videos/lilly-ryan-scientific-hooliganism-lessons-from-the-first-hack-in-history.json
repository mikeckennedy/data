  "description": "In 1903, Guglielmo Marconi prepared to unveil his world-first,\nlong-distance wireless communication technology to the Royal Institution\nin London. He was looking forward to roaring success, scientific\nacclaim, and a string of wealthy new customers - but he didn\u2019t count\nupon falling victim to the first hack in history.\n\nThis is a tale of business secrets, flame wars, stage magic, and\nmagnificent sideburns, direct from the records of Edwardian England.\n\nThe talk highlights several of the lessons that the FLOSS and\ninformation security communities can still learn from the fateful events\nof 1903. Marconi\u2019s tale is a master class in the necessity of open\nsource technology, as well as being a delightful introduction to the art\nof vulnerability reporting.\n",
