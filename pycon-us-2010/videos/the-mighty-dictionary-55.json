  "description": "The Mighty Dictionary\n\nPresented by Brandon Craig Rhodes\n\nBoth newcomers and experienced developers alike love Python's built-in\ndata types \u00e2\u20ac\u201d especially dictionaries! But how do dictionaries work?\nWhat do they do better than other container types, and where, on the\nother hand, are their weaknesses? Using simple, vivid diagrams that show\nthe secrets of how the dictionary is implemented, and a series of\nprogressively interesting examples of its behavior, we will train the\nPython developer's mind to picture what the dictionary is doing in just\nenough detail to make good decisions, as your data sets get larger,\nabout when to use dictionaries and when other data structures might be\nmore appropriate.\n",
