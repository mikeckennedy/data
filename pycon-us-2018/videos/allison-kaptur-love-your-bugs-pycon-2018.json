  "description": "Wrestling bugs can be one of the most frustrating parts of programming - but with the right framing, bugs can also be our best allies. I'll tell the tales of two of my favorite bugs, including the time I triggered a DDOS of a logging cluster, and explain why I love them. I'll also give you concrete strategies for approaching tricky bugs and making them easier and more fun.",
