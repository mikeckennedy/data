Jointly with David Ketcheson and Mauricio del Razo, we are developing the book as a series of Jupyter notebooks that include Python code for the reader to experiment with, and that employ interactive widgets and animation tools to provide a more active experience for students or researchers grappling with this theory. We are still experimenting with the best approach to developing material that works well in the notebook and also translates well to static webpages and hardcopy, with the hope of expanding its accessibility and usefulness. The current state of the project can be found in the Github repository https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book.",
