  "description": "Packages that won't install, encodings that don't work, installers that\nask too many questions, and having to own a PC are all great reasons to\njust ignore Windows. Or they would be, if they were true.\n\nDespite community perception, more than half of Python usage is on\nWindows, including web development, system administration, and data\nscience, just like on Linux and Mac. And for the most part, Python works\nthe same regardless of what operating system you happen to be using.\nStill, many library developers will unnecessarily exclude half of their\npotential audience by not even attempting to be compatible.\n\nThis session will walk through the things to be aware of when creating\ncross-platform libraries. From simple things like using ``pathlib``\nrather than ``bytes``, through to all the ways you can get builds and\ntests running on Windows for free, by the end of this session you will\nhave a checklist of easy tasks for your project that will really enable\nthe whole Python world to benefit from your work.\n",
