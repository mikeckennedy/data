  "description": "Intermediary level\n\nMetric learning is an area of machine learning which aims to learn a\ndistance (or similarity) measure between samples for a given task. In\nthis presentation, I will start by briefly introducing the main ideas of\nmetric learning and some of its applications, and show a concrete\nexample of using metric-learn, the metric learning library in Python. I\nwill then highlight the importance of making a machine learning package\ncompatible with scikit-learn and discuss the challenges in the specific\ncase of metric-learn, in particular regarding API constraints. Finally,\nwe will dig into metric-learn's code to illustrate the main design\nchoices, and emphasize some general issues (such as test design) that\nrequire special care when developing a machine learning toolbox.\n\nhttps://github.com/metric-learn/metric-learn\n",
