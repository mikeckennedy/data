  "summary": "Our challenge was to create a login system for little people who might\nbarely read, maybe no email, perhaps no home computer. And we had to\nwatch out for privacy laws - especially tough for minors. But these kids\nwant to play games, write stories, and create online avatars to share\nand compete against their buddies. Listen to how we developed the PBS\nKIDS login and moderation system in Django.\n",
