  "description": "Writing Books using Python and Open Source Software\n\nPresented by Mr. wesley j. chun\n\nThese days, there are countless number of software applications and web\nservices that have been developed using free and open source software\n(FOSS). Such tools have become so flexible, powerful, and universal,\nthat it should also be possible for authors to write manuscripts using\nopen source tools like Python in the same way that applications are\ndeveloped. In this talk, we present some case studies of this\nphenomenon.\n",
