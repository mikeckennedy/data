  "description": "Celtic music, and more specifically, Irish music has been around for at\nleast a few hundred years now. Being folk music, most of these tunes have\nbeen passed down the generations by ear causing many variations of the same\ntune to co-exist. Even today, as the tunes travel geographically, **they\ndevelop slight variations** according to the players' individual quirks.\n\nOver recent times, websites like [thesession.org](https://thesession.org/)\nare beginning to collect well-known tunes in databases made up of player\ncontributions. This particular website features both the *abc* and *midi*\nformats in addition to the staff notation. Players are allowed to contribute\ntheir own versions of popular tunes which makes this site very conducive to\nobserving **patterns in the variations**. This analysis will explore **how\nthese tunes changes across their newer versions and what makes some tunes\nchange more than the others**. It will define metrics by which tune\nvariations can be quantified and visualized and it will try to unearth\ncommon patterns in these variations.",
