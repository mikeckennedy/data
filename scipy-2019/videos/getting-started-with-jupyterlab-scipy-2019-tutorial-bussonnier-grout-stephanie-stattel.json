  "description": "JupyterLab is a new frontend for Jupyter. JupyterLab provides notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components arranged using tabs and collapsible sidebars. These components can be used together or separately (for example, a user can send code from a file to a console with a keystroke, or can pop out an output from a notebook to work with it alone). Users can install or write third-party plugins to view custom file formats, interact with external services, or display their data, such as interactive maps, tables, or plots. We'll walk users through JupyterLab and discuss the powerful new features in JupyterLab.",
