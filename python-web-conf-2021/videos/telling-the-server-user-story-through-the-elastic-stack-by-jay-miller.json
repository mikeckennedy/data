  "description": "\"Telling The Server User Story Through The Elastic Stack\" by: Jay Miller\nElastic has an ecosystem of products that to tell a story around both internal and external data. Companies use the Elastic Stack to gain insight on websites, businesses, and products.\n\nDiversityorgs.tech allows guests to search for diversity-focused orgs in their area.\n\nWe\u2019ll look at web traffic and examine trends in orgs searched. I'll explain ingesting that data from NGINX logs using Beats. We\u2019ll look at analytics from Elastic App Search and visualize this information with Kibana. Finally, we'll use that information to implement a new feature giving people requests based on their perceived area, ALL WHILE REQUIRING NO COOKIES OR TRACKING FROM OUR USERS.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
