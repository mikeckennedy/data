  "description": "Packaging is a hard problem. Still every language/distribution tries\nto invent packaging on their own. This leaves us (developers /\nsysadmins) with a big number of tools that we need to master in order\nto do our job. We will look at how Nix[1] and NixOS[2] can be used in\ntoday's software development processes and which are the benefits and\ndrawbacks you might face. In this talk we will look into how Nix can\nbe used to solve some problems we face when developing with python and\nhow it might just be the right tool for your next project.\n\n[1] Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems\nthat makes package management reliable and reproducible. It provides\natomic upgrades and rollbacks, side-by-side installation of multiple\nversions of a package, multi-user package management and easy setup of\nbuild environments.\n\n[2] NixOS is a Linux distribution built on top of the Nix package\nmanager, it is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems\nreliable, and has many other advantages.\n",
