  "description": "Computing power is a kind of power, but I\u2019m interested in a more\npowerful power: power over other people.\n\nI want to understand power and where it comes from. I\u2019m curious about\nthe balances and imbalances of power in our worlds of software\ndevelopment, how it moves around and where it goes. I want to know how\nit affects the people who have it, how they use it, and whether they\neven realise that they hold it.\n\nI believe that it really matters to open-source communities, that it\u2019s\npoorly understood, and that not understanding it has harmful\nconsequences for us.",
