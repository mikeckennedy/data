  "description": "\"Data Lakes and Streams with S3 and Lambda\" by: Justin Garrison\nYou have a data lake in S3 and it is providing great value. But it's formatted specifically for a single application and difficult to reuse. Should you copy the data and reformat it? Will you need to do that nightly as part of your ETL pipeline?
