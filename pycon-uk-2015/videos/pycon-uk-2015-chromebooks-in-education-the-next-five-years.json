  "description": "North American schools will, in 2015, buy 3.6 million chromebooks, out\nof global sales of 7.3 million (and 8 million predicted for 2016). In\nthis market they are outselling iPads and will soon challenge Microsoft.\nPerhaps Europe will follow.\n\nThis talk will give a social, economic and technical survey of\nchromebooks, looking ahead to the next five years. A major problem is\nusing chromebooks as a platform for learning Python. This is because,\nlike iPhones, they are locked down (except that they support a\n'developer mode' that allows your own version of Linux to be run as a\nguest operating system).\n\nThis year I replaced my laptop with a chromebook.",
