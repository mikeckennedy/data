  "description": "In this presentation, I\u2019d like to talk about Dropbox\u2019s Python code\nrepository, how we build and package it, so it can be safely deployed\nto production.\n\nSpecifically I\u2019d like to focus on the issues we had with dependency\nmanagement and how Bazel build system, which was open-sourced by\nGoogle early last year, helped us deal with it.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m going to cover lessons-learned and what plumbing was done in\norder to make Bazel work for Dropbox in development, test and\nproduction environment.\n\nKey take-aways for attendees:\n\n* An approach to introducing dependency management system into existing codebase\n* Better understanding of how Bazel works in real-world\n",
