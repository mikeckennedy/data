  "description": "Abstractions make things appear simple. This is one of the main concepts\nbehind OOP. So what is it?! This talk provides some guidelines on how to\nachieve scalable abstractions and demystify some of the confusion around\nit. One could say, I'll try to abstract the abstraction itself :)\n\nTerry Yanchynskyy Bio\n---------------------\n\nTerry (Taras) is a software engineer on the Payments team at\n`Wave <https://www.waveapps.com/>`__.
