  "description": "\"How To Get On This Stage (And What To Do When You Get There)\" by: Mark Smith\nSpeaking at a programming conference may seem like an impossible goal for many people, for a number of reasons: fear of public speaking, the feeling that you don\u2019t know enough to give a talk, you don\u2019t think you have any good ideas for a talk, or maybe the idea that public speaking is very difficult. I\u2019m going to persuade you that you should get up on stage and give a talk to your peers. Once I\u2019ve persuaded you that you should give a talk, then I\u2019m going to show you how.\n\nComing up with an idea\nComing up with an idea can sometimes be the hardest part! I\u2019ll cover how to get (and keep) ideas by looking at what you do every day, what you know most about, and keeping a notebook of ideas so that when the time comes to submit a proposal, you\u2019ll have plenty of choice.\n\nSubmitting a proposal\nSubmitting a proposal to a CFP can seem quite daunting. Even if it doesn\u2019t seem daunting, there are a bunch of things you can get wrong that make it less likely for your talk to be accepted. I\u2019ll give you several tips for increasing your chances of being selected. I\u2019ll also talk about rejection and why you shouldn\u2019t feel dejected about being rejected. (It happens to everyone!)\n\nWriting a talk\nI\u2019ll describe some processes for writing a talk and building a slide deck to match (if you want to!) I\u2019ll cover some different styles of public speaking, including how to find your own style, and I\u2019ll talk about live coding. (With a strong recommendation that you shouldn\u2019t do it - at least until you\u2019ve got more experience.)\n\nPreparation\nPractice, practice, practice! Many inexperienced speakers underestimate how much rehearsal is required to give a great talk; I\u2019m going to correct this misunderstanding! I\u2019ll cover some different approaches to ensuring that you\u2019re less nervous when it\u2019s time to step on to the stage, and you\u2019ve maximized your chances of your talk going smoothly.\n\nGiving your talk\nAfter you\u2019ve had an idea, had your proposal accepted, written your talk, designed your slides, and practiced (and practiced and practiced) it\u2019ll be time to step behind the lectern and give your talk! I\u2019ll give you tried and tested advice from experienced speakers to help your talk go smoothly.\n\nAnd you know what? Even if some things go wrong you\u2019ll still be applauded enthusiastically by an audience of your peers!\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
