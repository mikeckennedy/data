  "description": "In this talk I hope to give a clear overview of the opportunities for applying Thompson Sampling in machine learning. I will share some technical examples in recent developments (for example Bayesian Neural Networks using Edward) but more importantly I hope to trigger the audience to start thinking strategically about how we want our machine learning models to learn from new data.",
