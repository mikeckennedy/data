  "description": "Not everyone gets paid to work with Python all the time, but if you find\nyourself in a Java project, there are good chances you could benefit\nfrom Python without throwing out the Java stack. Using Jython, you can\ndo rapid prototyping without the long edit-compile-test cycles normally\nassociated with large Java projects, whether on the web or the desktop,\nand when testing an application might become a nightmare of scaffolding\nin Java, a little Jython may be just what you need to be able to run\nyour tests smoothly.\n\nAt the end of this talk, I will put on my politician\u00b4s hat and bring up\nthe best - and worst - arguments to use to get permission to use Jython\nin a corporate environment.\n",
