  "description": "HTTP/RESTful APIs are often designed and implemented before a client gets to see how they work. Then once an API is made public it can be hard to change. Let's discuss how we can improve this process by explicitly designing the API contract and getting client feedback before implementation. We will examine the process which promotes building HTTP APIs with a design first approach.",
