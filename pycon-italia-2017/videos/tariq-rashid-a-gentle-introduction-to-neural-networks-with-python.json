  "description": "A gentle introduction to neural networks, and making your own with\nPython.\n\nThis session is especially designed to be accessible to everyone,\nincluding anyone with no expertise in mathematics, computer science or\nPython.\n\nFrom this session you will have an intuitive understanding of what\nneural networks are and how they work. If you are more technically\ncapable, you will see how you could make your own with Python and numpy.\n\nPart 1 - Ideas:\n\n- the search for AI, hard problems for computers easy for humans\n- learning from examples (simple classifier)\n- biologically inspired neurons and networks\n- training a neural network\n- the back propagation breakthrough\n- matrix ways of working (good for computers)\n\nPart 2 - Python:\n\n- Python is easy, and everywhere\n- Python notebooks\n- the MNIST data set\n- a very simple neural network class\n- focus on concise and efficient matrix calculations with numpy\n- 97.5% accuracy recognising handwritten numbers - with just a few lines of code!\n\nPart 3 - Live Demo! \u2026 and Q&A\n",
