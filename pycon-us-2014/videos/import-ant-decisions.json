  "summary": "Suppose ``import`` didn't exist, and we had to invent it from scratch.\nWe'll look at the problem - code sharing and reuse across modules - and\ndifferent ways we could solve it. We'll come up with ``import`` from\nparallel universes and then reinvent python's actual implementation.\nFinally, we'll import - using python's design - without using the\n``import`` keyword.\n",
