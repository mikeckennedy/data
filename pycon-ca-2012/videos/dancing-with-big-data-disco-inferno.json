  "summary": "In our search for a better Map/Reduce framework we found Disco, an\nErlang/Python based Map/Reduce framework that's small, fast, elegant,\nunderstandable. We needed a way to tame the power of Disco and that's\nwhen we came up with the Inferno project which takes even more\ncomplexity out of Map/Reduce. With Inferno you concentrate about what\nyou want from your data and not the underlying complexity.\n",
