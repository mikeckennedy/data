  "description": "CVXPY is a domain-specific language for convex optimization embedded in\nPython. It allows the user to express convex optimization problems in a\nnatural syntax that follows the math, rather than in the restrictive\nstandard form required by solvers. CVXPY has been used in hundreds of\nresearch projects and by Fortune 500 companies. In this talk, we will\nshow how easy it is to formulate and solve optimization problems with\nCVXPY through example applications in finance and renewable energy. The\ntalk is intended for anyone with a basic Python and math background who\nis interested in optimization or its applications.Presenter(s): Speaker:\nSteven Diamond, Stanford University\n",
