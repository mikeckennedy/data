  "summary": "Money, Money, Money - Writing software, in a rich (wo)man's world\n\nFree software advocates talk about two types of \"Free\": Free as in\nfreedom, and Free as in beer. While Free (as in freedom) software is\nunquestionably better for users and developers alike, Free (as in beer)\nsoftware doesn't pay the bills.\n\nTalk to any prominent open source developer, and amongst the success\nstories, you'll also hear some consistent troubles - that they've got\ngreat ideas and grand plans, but no time to execute; that they're about\nto burn out due to the pressues of maintaining their project; or that\nthey've had yet another mailing list discussion with someone who doesn't\nunderstand they're a volunteer. All of these problems stem from a\nfundamental disconnect: the discrepancy between the clear demand for a\nsoftware product, and the ability to convert that demand into time\nneeded to service that demand - and that means money.\n",
