  "description": "From the beginning of time, the relationship between developers and\nsoftware testers has always been that of 'Cat and Mouse'. This\nrelationship has had its fair share of short comings which chiefly\nincluded unmet deadlines and lack of confidence when shipping\nsoftware products. The talk is meant to introduce a better\nrelationship between developers and testers by going over the\nimportance of including testing in an Agile cycle.\n\nWe will look at different levels of testing E.g. Unit vs integration\ntesting, how units work together. Knowing why we are writing each test -\nwhat are we trying to achieve when we write a test for a unit as that is\na place that developers struggle and either write duplicate tests or not\nenough and changeability and confidence can suffer as a result.\n\nObjective is to build better agile software teams and ship clean python\nprojects with confidence.\n",
