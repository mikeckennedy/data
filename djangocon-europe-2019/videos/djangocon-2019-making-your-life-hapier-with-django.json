  "description": "In today\u2019s web, creating API\u2019s has become a big part of web-development. Django and Django REST Framework make our lives easy :-) But let\u2019s take it a notch further with DRF-Schema-Adapter.\nWhen it comes to building API\u2019s with Django, Django REST Framework has become the go-to solution. It is a great tool that integrates seamlessly with Django and it\u2019s ORM.\nUnfortunately when building a medium-to-large API, DRF leads to a lot of very similar and somewhat repetitive code in building your ViewSet, Serializer, Pagination or Filter classes. In the long-run, all this code also has to be maintained!\nThis is where DRF-Schema-Adapter can make your life easier and happier!\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll go over the basics of building an API with DRF versus using DRF-Schema-Adapter and how it will help shrink your codebase.\n",
