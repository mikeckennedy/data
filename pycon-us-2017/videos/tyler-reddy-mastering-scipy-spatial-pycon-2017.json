  "description": "The heavily-used scipy library is so large that each of the major\nmodules could fill its own tutorial syllabus. It is also\nproduction-quality software with a 1.0 release imminent. In this\ntutorial, my focus is to cover the scipy.spatial component of the\nlibrary in great detail, from the perspective of a heavy user and active\ndeveloper of the computational geometry components of scipy. From\ndistance matrices to Voronoi diagrams and Hausdorff distances, we will\nexplore the corners of scipy.spatial code--both long-established\nfeatures and even proposed features that haven't yet made it into a\nstable release.\n",
