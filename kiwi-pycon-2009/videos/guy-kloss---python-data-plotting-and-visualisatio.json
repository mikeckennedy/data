  "description": "Python Data Plotting and Visualization Extravaganza\n\nPresented by Guy Kloss\n\nAbstract\n\nIn various fields data is accumulated or produced. This can be\nobservation data, statistical data, simulation data, ... Information\nlike that can in many cases be much more easily analysed through the\nuser's eyes employing data visualisation. This talk is trying to dive\nbriefly into various means and tools to visually analyse data of\ndifferent qualities: time series, simple 2D plots, surface plots, volume\nplots, quiver plots, etc.\n\nOutline\n\nI am planning on doing a \"fly by\" through the world of data\nvisualisation for different types of data using different tools. Types\nof data:\n\n-  1D data and simple functions\n-  2D data for surface plots\n-  3D data through quiver plots, iso surfaces, and cutting planes\n-  n-D data through different means\n-  continuous and non-continuously structured data\n-  time series\n-  real time data visualisation/analysis\n\nThe tools that will probably appear in the demos and discussions:\n\n-  GNUplot\n-  matplotlib\n-  Mayavi2\n-  Visual Python\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n",
