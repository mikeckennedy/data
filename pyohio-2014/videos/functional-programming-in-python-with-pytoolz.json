  "summary": "Learn the principles of functional programming from the comfort of\nPython. I'll motivate the principles of standardization, composability,\nlaziness, and purity within a standard workflow. We'll go far beyond the\nstandard libraries ``itertools`` and ``functools`` by using a functional\nstandard library ``toolz`` and its high-performance counterpart\n``cytoolz`` written in Cython.\n",
