  "description": "From Python 3, type hinting was prompted. Thanks to this, static type\nanalysis is now available in Python\u2019s world. It is possible to use this\nmechanism with mypy, intellij etc. In this session we will learn about\ntype hinting in Python 3.5 / 3.6/ 3.7. Next, learn how to use static\ntype analysis using mypy. It is also possible to use mypy not only in\nPython 3 but also in Python 2. In other words, it is said to demonstrate\ngreat power to port Python 2 code to Python 3. In fact there are already\nsuccesses like the following projects.\n\nThroughout this session, I am pleased that you can think about writing\npython code and writing tests.\n\nBlog: http://blog.zulip.org/2016/10/13/static-types-in-python-oh-mypy/\n",
