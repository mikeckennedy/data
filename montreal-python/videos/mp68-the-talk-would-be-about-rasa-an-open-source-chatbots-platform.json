  "description": "Most chatbots rely on external APIs for the cool stuff such as natural language understanding (NLU) and disappoint because if and else conditionals fail at delivering good representations of our non linear human way to converse. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could 1) take control of NLU and tweak it to better fit our needs and 2) really apply machine learning, extract patterns from real conversations, and handle dialogue in a decent manner? Well, we can, thanks to Rasa.ai. It\u2019s open-source, it\u2019s in Python, and it works.\n\nMontr\u00e9al-Python 68: Wysiwyg Xylophone \nhttps://montrealpython.org/2017/11/mp68/",
