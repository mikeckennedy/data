  "summary": "Donald Knuth famously said that we should avoid optimization 97% of the\ntime and focus on the \"critical 3%\". How can we identify that 3%? How\ncan we best focus our optimization efforts, and avoid the \"root of all\nevil\" that is premature optimization? This talk introduces key types of\nperformance testing, and demonstrates how they can be paired with\nprofiling techniques in a cycle of improvement.\n",
