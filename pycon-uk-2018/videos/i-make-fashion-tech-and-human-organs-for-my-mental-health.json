  "description": "I am an engineer of all sorts. I tinker with electronics, fashion, programming and stem cells.\n\nI would like to share my knowledge and experiences in both wearable\nfashion technology (what it is, what we can do with it, why its\nrelevant) that i have created with various programming languages\nincluding python as a creative hobby outlet, and in tissue engineering\nwith stem cells which is my profession. The aim of my talk is really to\nmake people aware that you can have multiple interests and it is highly\nencouraged for a fulfilling lifestyle and improved mental health. In\nadults, having work that you're passionate about can easily engulf your\nwhole life easily ignoring other needs in life. It is so easy to go on\nwithout realising that if work was taken away from you, you haven't got\nanything else. There is a fear of trying something new due to not\nenjoying it or not being good at it. In teenagers and children, they are\noften blindsided by stereotypes. Young girls that I have spoken to feel\nthere is a pressure to give up fashion and beauty in pursuing a STEM\ncareer or education. I set myself in this instance as a role model to\nshow that people generally are multidirectional and cross-disciplinary\ninterest is easy to get into, unique, beneficial and sought after.",
