  "description": "New open source communities are born everyday. Some of them are meant to\nlast long and some others aren\u2019t. There\u2019s a moment in every community\nwhere it needs to outgrow itself, expand its limits and aim way higher\nthan ever. This is no necesarily related to its goals but the ecosystem\nit needs to stay alive.\n\nOnce a community has gone beyond its limits, the community members,\nconsumers and leaders will have to keep up with its pace. How do we help\nit to remain sane? How do we keep our goals on track while allowing for\nfurther growth? How do we allow it to keep expanding without further\ndamaging the community?\n\nThese are all questions we ask ourselves everyday in the OpenStack\ncommunity and that we\u2019ve managed to work on without killing ourselves on\nthe way.\n",
