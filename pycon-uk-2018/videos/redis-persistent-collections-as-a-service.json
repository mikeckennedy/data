  "description": "A quick introduction to Redis, and why I really like it\n\nI recently had to learn about Redis for work, and was very pleased at\nhow well designed it is, and how much fun it is to use. Several times I\nwent to look for a piece of functionality, and there it was, doing\nexactly what I wanted. I am especially fond of BRPOPLPUSH.\n\nI propose to give a brief introduction to what Redis is and does, an\noverview of the redis-py client and fakeredis for unit testing, and if\nthere's time, some discussion of asyncio programming using aioredis.\n\nAt the end, I hope that the audience will know a bit about a genuinely\nuseful tool that can be used as a datestore, and also for\ncross-communication between many programming languages. And maybe\nthey'll share some of my enthusiasm.",
