  "description": "Guido admitted in his PyCon 2014 keynote that he will never again\nconduct a language transition like that from Python 2 to Python 3. The\nvast majority of Python code written in 2014 is still a ``SyntaxError``\non the latest version of Python. Some people have been wondering: will\nPython 3 ever take off?\n\nWe have done some data mining from PyPI to reveal what progress the\ncommunity has made so far toward migrating the long tail of packages\ntowards Python 3 and which packages are most critical in the dependency\ngraph of unported packages. We extrapolate from current growth rates\nabout when (if ever) Python 3 support will reach a tipping point after\nwhich more new code will be written in Python 3 than Python 2.\n\nWe then share our perspective on mistakes made in the Python 3\ntransition and lessons that we can all learn from. The lessons apply to\nmigrating any interface -- a language, a codebase, or a web API.\n",
