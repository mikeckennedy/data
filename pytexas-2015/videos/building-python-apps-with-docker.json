  "description": "If you haven't heard of Docker yet, its a great tool that allows you\nwrap up your app and everything it needs to run: code, runtime, and even\nsystem libraries and guarantee that it will always run the same,\nregardless of the environment (local machine, server, or even the\ncloud). Whether you're deploying a web app, performing data analysis, or\ncreating local environments for your dev team or CI builds, Docker can\nhelp.\n\nI'll give an introduction to Docker, an overview of some of the current\ntools in the Docker ecosystem (Docker Machine and Docker Compose) and\ndemonstrate how to create, build, and deploy Python applications using\nDocker.\n\nThis talk is targeted towards web developers, data scientists, or really\nanyone who develops using Python that would like to learn more about\nDocker and how it can help their projects.\n",
