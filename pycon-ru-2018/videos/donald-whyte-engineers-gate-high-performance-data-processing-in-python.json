  "description": "**Donald Whyte** , Engineers Gate\n\n`**High Performance Data Processing in\nPython** <http://pycon.ru/2018/en/program/content/whyte/>`__\n\nThe Internet age generates vast amounts of data. Most of this data is\nunstructured and needs to cleaned. Python has become the standard tool\nfor transforming this data into more useable forms.\n\nnumpy and pandas are the most popular Python libraries for processing\nlarge quantities of data. For small datasets, these libraries do the job\nwithout much effort. However, when running complex transformations on\nlarger datasets, many developers fall into common pitfalls that kill the\nperformance of these libraries.\n\nThis talk explains how numpy and pandas work under the hood and how they\nuse vectorisation to process large amounts of data extremely quickly. We\nshow an example dataset being processed using numpy/pandas. We\ndemonstrate how to use these libraries effectively, reducing the\nprocessing time of this large dataset from several hours to seconds.\n",
