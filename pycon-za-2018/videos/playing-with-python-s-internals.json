  "description": "This talk will look at two of my libraries which stretch the limits of\nwhat's possible with Python:\n\n1. `birdseye <https://github.com/alexmojaki/birdseye>`__, a debugger\n   that records the value of every expression for easy viewing, and\n2. `sorcery <https://github.com/alexmojaki/sorcery>`__, a framework for\n   writing magical functions which know the context in which they are\n   called.\n\nThey work by inspecting and manipulating Python's inner workings:\nexecution frames, code objects, and most importantly the Abstract Syntax\nTree (AST). I will give an overview of these concepts and explain how\nsome parts of the libraries work.\n\nThis is for people interested in peeking under the hood of Python from\nwithin Python, i.e. no C and no messing with the interpreter.\n",
