  "summary": "Python is a great language for prototyping computer vision algorithms,\nthe availability of libraries such as Numpy and Scipy make for rapid\ndevelopment similar to that of Matlab, R and IDL. At the Bureau of\nMeteorology (BoM) we are solving the interesting problem of weather\nfield warping. Warping (aka non-linear image registration) is used, for\nexample, to determine what the predicted temperature will be hourly if\nwe only have predictions every three hours\n",
