  "description": "Math is a crucial skill for people who are interested in Data Science\nand Machine Learning. Until now, most of the people who are doing Data\nScience have a strong background in math, usually, people with master or\nPh.D. degrees.\n\nHowever, this fact seems to change in the next years, after the hype of\nMachine Learning we are facing a process of *democratization*. Now the\ndoor of Data Science is open for everyone.\n\nTo *truly madly deeply* understand how the machine learning algorithms\nwork we need to understand some mathematical concepts. In this tutorial,\nI would like to share my experience in the process of learning some of\nthose concepts.\n\nWhat I want to do is build a bridge between those concepts and Python,\nmore specifically, *SciPy* and *NumPy* and *TensorFlow*. Basically is\n*just another tutorial about vectorization* , in this case, oriented to\nunderstand and implement machine learning algorithms and the\nmathematical foundation that supports it.\n\nOutline\n-------\n\n-  *Review of linear algebra* : A brief review of essential *linear\n   algebra* , concepts and the explanation with NumPy: scalars, vectors,\n   matrices, tensors, multiplication of vectors, inner products, vector\n   spaces, etc.\n-  *Review of machine learning* : A brief review of essential *machine\n   learning* , concepts that are related to mathematical concepts:\n   dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis, etc.\n-  *Optimization* : Analytical vs. numerical solutions. This part has\n   too many formulas, *well, not too many*.\n-  *Vectorization* : Numpy and TensorFlow.\n-  Small practical cases:\n\n   -  I want to show how we can solve the XOR problem with only one\n      neuron\n   -  Explain the math behind linear regression.\n\nThe material of the talk can be found\n`here <https://github.com/omartrinidad/ep2018>`__\n",
