  "description": "Failure can be scary. There are real costs to a company and its users\nwhen software crashes, models are inaccurate, or when systems go down.\nThe emotional stakes feel high-- no one wants to be responsible for a\nfailure. We can lower the stakes by creating spaces to learn from\nfailures, and minimize their impact. This talk introduces two ways to\naddress failure: blameless post-mortems, to learn from an incident; and\npre-mortems, to identify modes of failure upfront.\n",
