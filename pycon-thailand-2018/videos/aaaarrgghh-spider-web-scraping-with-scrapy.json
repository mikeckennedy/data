  "description": "A quick yet reasonably thorough introduction to Scrapy, the high-level web crawling & scraping framework for Python. Includes a demo, cause I like living on the edge.\nThe \"core concepts demo\" is a hands-on introduction, starting from a simple example and progressively adding more features. It covers the following topics:\n* Spiders (Spider, CrawlSpider, etc)\n* Selectors (XPath, CSS, Regex, etc)\n* Items & item loaders\n* Input & output processors\n* Pipelines\nSlides from the previous version of this talk: https://speakerdeck.com/citizen428/aaaarrgghh-spider-web-scraping-with-scrapy\n\n\n\n--------\n\nRuby developer since ~2003. Py-curious, Love FP. I talk a lot about programming.",
