  "description": "\"Serverless & Microservices Monitoring In An IoT World\" by: Erez Berkner\nServerless technology is a great fit for IoT workloads, and indeed we witness a constant growth in usage. When you have many sensors that are very distributed and generate a high volume of invocations, monitoring and troubleshooting become a huge challenge. In this talk we will cover: \n- Why microservices, serverless & IoT devices are so difficult to monitor \n- Understand the current methods for making microservices, serverless & IoT applications observable \n- See best practices for monitoring microservices, serverless & IoT with real-world examples\n\nJoin us and gain back control over your IoT environment.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
