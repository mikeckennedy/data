  "description": "A tour de France through tools that allow you to care more about\nbuilding than obsessing over formatting and other easily correctable\nissues in your and others code. Probably some analysis of how often\nstyling/pep8 is mentioned in Python PRs and code reviews...\n\n------\n\nSebastian Hillig is a software engineer at Artory, a New York/Berlin\ncompany that is working to bring more transparency to the art market.\n\nIn true startup fashion, he wears many hats, including the ones of\nproduct owner, engineering team lead and smoothie happiness supplier.\nWith more than a decade of professional experience working on\nsoftware, Python has been a stable companion while product and\naccompanying languages have been in a constant state of flux: VoIP\nmonitoring to database prototypes, C++ to Smalltalk, custom websites\nto enterprise applications, and compiler benchmarks to user testing.\n\nGood developer experience is one of his pet penchants, improving\nanything from environment to tooling. In his free time, Sebastian\npractices karate, smashes volleyballs, toys around with new\ntechnologies, and reads about software engineering best practices and\nmartial arts.",
