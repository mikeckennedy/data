  "description": "Over the last six years, small- and large-scale replication efforts have\nraised the suspicion that a large number of psychological\nfindings\u2014including some of our dearest effects\u2014are flimsy at best.\n\u201cStandard Operating Procedures\u201d of the field have been shown to result\nin false-positive rates close to 100%; articles are filled with\nreporting errors and impossible statistics; transparency of the\nscientific process is often abysmal. These shortcomings have resulted in\nan unprecedented level of scientific introspection, giving rise to the\ndevelopment of new meta-scientific methods, new modes of scientific\npublishing, and a strong push towards Open Science, which will be\ncovered in this talk.\n\nBiographical sketch\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nJulia Rohrer is a personality psychologist and pursues her PhD at the\nInternational Max Planck Research School on the Life Course, the German\nInstitute for Economic Research, the Free University of Berlin, and the\nUniversity of Leipzig. She is an outspoken advocate for Open Science and\nthe current movement towards greater methodological rigor in psychology.\nShe is one of the authors of the meta-scientific blog \u201cThe 100% CI.\u201d",
