  "description": "Orobix is an engineering company focused on delivering AI-based\nsolutions to businesses, in multiple domains including life-science and\nmanufacturing.\n\nThe application of deep learning to real world problems and mission\ncritical contexts is laden with potential pitfalls, involving project\nexecution all the way to the deployment of\n\nmodels in production. Orobix has engineered systems with deep learning\nat their core, ranging from medical image segmentation to industrial\nquality inspection. In its operations, Orobix has devised strategies to\ncope with the cost of collecting data, gathering annotations from\nexperts, training data- efficient models, deploying models in\nproduction, monitoring and communicating results back to experts. This\ntalk represents an opportunity for us to share where we started from and\nwhere we\u2019re at, what worked and what didn\u2019t, and what we think is laying\nahead of us, both individually and collectively in the applied AI\ncommunity.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1807\n\nin \\_\\_on **Saturday 4 May** at 12:15 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
