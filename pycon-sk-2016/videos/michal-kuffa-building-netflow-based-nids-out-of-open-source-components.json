  "description": "Netflow exporters provide extremely important information about what is\ngoing on in your network almost in real time. As the network grows, to\nstore and analyze collected flow information starts to be a tedious\ntask.\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to outline how to use open source\ntechnologies to move from RRD files as a mean of storage of flow data\nand take full advantage of Netflow's (almost) real time nature to create\nNIDS with all the related data right at hand, visualized and ready to be\ndiagnosed.\n",
