  "description": "In many Python circles, Twisted is the recommended framework for all\nnetworking and multitasking applications. Twisted provides a powerful,\nextensible event-driven framework with built-in support for many network\nprotocols. But without due care, Twisted\u2019s event-driven features can\nresult in code that\u2019s a nightmare to read and maintain. In this\npresentation, I will review the basics of Twisted, and show some of the\nfeatures which make Twisted such a popular framework. I\u2019ll share my\nexperiences debugging and maintaining mission-critical Twisted\napplications, discuss some of the pitfalls to avoid when coding with\nTwisted, and present tips and tricks for debugging Twisted code and\nwriting Twisted code that\u2019s a pleasure to read and maintain.\n",
