  "description": "Sherlock is a diagnostics framework used to assess fleet health within\nOracle Public Cloud. It is developed in Python, and operates within a\nrestricted Python environment, but has been designed to overcome the\nchallenges of our enterprise environment.\n\nThis talk will provide an overview of the restricted Python environment\nin which Sherlock operates and discuss how Sherlock has leveraged\nfeatures of Python to maintain its independence. It will highlight the\ndesign challenges that were faced to ensure that the framework could be\nrobust and lightweight. As part of the talk, I will showcase how we've\nutilised Python's strengths to provide a framework which easily allows\ndevelopers from vastly different teams to write diagnostic scripts to\neasily asses service health across a global fleet.\n",
