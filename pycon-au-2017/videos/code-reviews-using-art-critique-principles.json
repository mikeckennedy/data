  "description": "Code reviews don\u2019t have to be a time consuming, morale zapping, arduous tasks. Not only can they catch bugs and errors but they can contribute in positive ways to the individual developer, the team, management and company as a whole.\n\nArt critiques have existed in academia for hundreds of years. The methodology of the critique has evolved to be time sensitive and productive, while keeping the enthusiasm of the student artist intact.\n\nThe purpose of the art critique is to get peers and mentors to look at the work and raise any problems they may see. It\u2019s also time where people with more experience could contribute their knowledge in a helpful way. This process is about producing the best work, quickly and in a productive and constructive way.\n\nThese methods can be applied to code review.\n\nPyCon attendees will come away from this talk with a set of methods that will enable them to preform constructive code reviews using art critique principles.",
