  "description": "Django looks like it\u2019s doing just fine: it\u2019s a popular framework in a\npopular language. We have major releases every six months. We have\nDjango Girls, a Foundation (and Fellows), super conferences in glamorous\nlocations, and more.\n\nBut the code is old, there are 1300+ accepted open issues. There\u2019s only\nthe smallest number of people that regularly contribute code.\n\nIt\u2019s fine now. But it won\u2019t be. Your web framework needs you!\n\nContributing to open source is great, and it\u2019s great for you.\nHistorically we\u2019ve not been that good at encouraging new and diverse\ncontributors. We\u2019re trying to change that, and we want to invite you to\ncome and join-in.\n\nI\u2019m going to tell you quickly how to get involved, how to get support in\nthat, and how to let us know if that\u2019s failing.\n\nYou are qualified to contribute. More than that, your contribution is\nthe future of Django. Come code.\n",
