  "description": "Reinforcement learning is a sequential decision making framework that\nhas received a lot of attention given incredible results from DeepMind,\nDQN and AlphaGo. More recently DeepMind delivered a more general AI game\nplayer call AlphaZero, which learns by self-play.\n\nDuring this session we will introduce you the key ideas behind\nAlphaZero:\n\n-  Reinforcement Learning and Value function\n-  MonteCarlo Tree Search\n-  Self-play\n\nWe will explore how they contribute to beat greatest Go player of our\ntime, in Python.\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. Introduction to AI in games\n2. What AlphaZero is made of? (Boring theory)\n3. How to build your own AlphaZero? (Cool code)\n\nin \\_\\_on **domenica 22 aprile** at 15:30 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
