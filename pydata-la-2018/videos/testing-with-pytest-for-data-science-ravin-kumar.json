  "abstract": "This tutorial is intended to take someone unfamiliar with testing, and\nby the end have them writing functional and useful tests. The tutorial\nwill be a series of exercises introducing various concepts in testing.\nBy the end you should have a good idea of where and how to implement\ntesting in your next project\n\nYou're encouraged to participate\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis will be an interactive tutorial where attendees are encouraged to\nbring their laptops. Code will be provided, please be sure to install\npython 3 and pytest before the tutorial to avoid issues at the tutorial\nitself.\n\nA git repository with all the code used will be made available during\nthe tutorial.\n\nTopics covered\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe'll be answering the questions\n\nTesting basics\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWhat is testing? Why is it useful in general? Why is it useful in a data\ncontext?\n\nLibraries\n^^^^^^^^^\n\nWhat are the available libraries for python?\n\nYour first test\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nHow do I structure my first test? How do I run a test?\n\nYour first fixture\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWhat are fixtures? How do I use them? When should I use them?\n\nExtra cool functionality\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWhat are the more advanced features of pytest? What should I look for,\nfor future learning?\n",

Testing is useful\nin data applications as well, from testing assumptions about the\nunderlying structure of information, to testing your knowledge of math\nlibraries.\n\nIn this tutorial we'll showing you how to use pytest from scratch. By\nthe end you'll know enough to be able to use it in your next project.\n",
