  "description": "Over the years, I\u2019ve led, and been a member of, numerous technical teams\non a wide variety of projects. Based on that experience, this talk will\ndescribe my personal observations on the role of the leader in that sort\nof team.\n\nThe talk will be in 5 sections:\n\n-  Introduction - A bit about my background so you can judge whether to\n   bother staying for the rest.\n\n   -  Authority - Where it comes from and the challenges you might face\n      depending on the answer.\n   -  Priorities - What should you be focussing upon?\n   -  Style - There are many leadership styles, but what\u2019s yours and\n      what\u2019s appropriate for technical teams?\n   -  Process - What\u2019s your role in defining and managing process?\n\nThere is no prior knowledge or experience required whatsoever. The talk\nis aimed equally at anyone considering a leadership role for the first\ntime or who has been doing so for many years.\n",
