  "description": "WSGI is the foundation of most Python web frameworks, but there's a good chance you've never had to interact with it directly. In this talk we'll explore why it exists, how it works, and what the heck it's doing in your stack.\n\nA great web framework abstracts away all the low-level stuff so that you can focus on the core functionality of your application. This is helpful for getting you going quickly but can be a source of frustration when you want to start optimizing your application. In the Law of Leaky Abstractions Joel Spolsky makes the case that abstracting away the low-level stuff prevents us from learning important concepts.\n\nSo let's learn about WSGI.\n\nWSGI is the Web Server Gateway Interface and it's the foundation of almost every Python web framework. This isn't going to be a talk that you'll walk out of with immediate tips for tuning your web service (don't worry, Graham Dumpleton has that covered). Instead, you'll develop an appreciation for the low-level goings on of your stack every time you handle a request.\n\nThis talk is intended primarily for Python web developers, but should be approachable for anyone with an intermediate experience of Python. I look forward to talking to you!\n\nPresentation page -- https://2018.pycon.ca/talks/talk-PC-55186/",
