  "description": "Paige Bailey is a Sr. Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft specializing in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Paige\u2019s education was focused on the earth sciences (geophysics, carbonate geology) and computer science (data analytics); and her previous work experience was geared toward drilling and completions optimization, data science, and geophysical plug-in development for the energy industry. When Paige is not sitting in front of glowing rectangular screens at work, she absolutely adores hiking / kayaking / mountain-biking around Texas\u2019 glorious Green Belt; resuscitating Apple ][s; and (poorly!) attempting to play bass guitar. Personal passions are sustainable energy and climate change research; STEM education reform; and empowering local governments via data science.",
