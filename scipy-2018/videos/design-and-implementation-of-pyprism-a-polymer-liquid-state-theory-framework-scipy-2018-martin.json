  "description": "Polymer Reference Interaction Site Model (PRISM) theory describes the\nequilibrium spatial-correlations, thermodynamics, and structure of\nliquid-like polymer systems and macromolecular materials. Here, we\npresent a Python-based, open-source framework, pyPRISM, for conducting\nPRISM theory calculations. pyPRISM provides data structures, functions,\nand classes that streamline predictive PRISM calculations and can be\nextended for use in other tasks such as the coarse-graining of atomistic\nsimulation force-fields or the modeling of experimental scattering data.\nThe goal of providing this framework is to reduce the barrier to\ncorrectly and appropriately using PRISM theory and to provide a platform\nfor rapid calculations of the structure and thermodynamics of polymeric\nfluids and nanocomposites.Presenter(s): Speaker: Tyler Martin, NIST\nAuthor: Thomas Gartner, University of Delaware Author: Ronald Jones,\nNIST Author: Chad Snyder, NIST Author: Arthi Jayaraman, University of\nDelaware\n",
