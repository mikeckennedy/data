  "description": "Day 2, 09:10\u201310:10\n\nI consider myself relatively new to the open source world; my first open source contribution was in summer of 2016. Pretty soon I found myself being given commit rights to other people\u2019s open source projects. Being a new open source maintainer brings a set of unique challenges that I was not fully prepared for. In this talk, I will share my journey and the things I\u2019ve learned along the way, and some advice for other aspiring open source maintainers and contributors.\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\n\nSpeaker: Mariatta Wijaya\n\nMariatta is a Python Core Developer, a software engineer at Zapier, Vancouver PyLadies co-organizer, and one of the founding members of the PyCascades conference. She moved to Canada almost two decades ago and now lives in Vancouver with her husband and two children. In her free time, she contributes to open source, builds GitHub bots, fixes typos, and likes to tell you about f-strings. Her favorite emoji is \ud83d\ude1d.",
