  "description": "Much has been written about asynchronous programming in Python,\nespecially after the introduction of asyncio into the standard library\nof the language. We\u2019ve all seen the benchmarks that tell us how\nasyncio-powered web servers massively outperform their non-asyncio\ncounterparts for trivial routes and we\u2019ve seen the articles that tell us\nhow to make the move from flask to aiohttp and why we should.\n\nDespite all of this, the question remains: How is it to use asyncio in a\nproduction setting? What are the pain points of migrating a large\napplication to use asyncio? How does the performance of this real-world\napplication differ after the migration? Is it still just unicorns and\nfairy tales? The goal of this talk is to address these questions.\n\nIf you are curious about taking the step from asyncio-dabbling to\ncreating actual mission critical software systems in asyncio; this is\nthe talk for you!\n",
