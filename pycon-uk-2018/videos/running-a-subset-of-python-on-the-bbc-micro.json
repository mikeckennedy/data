  "description": "Yes, the one from the 80's. Yes, I'm a little mad.\n\nFollowing on from my talk last year on making a C compiler for the BBC\nMicro, I will be using said compiler to write and run a python\ninterpreter that can run on the BBC Micro. Come to learn about how\ncompilers work in general, how python is technically a compiled and\ninterpreted language, the struggles I had fitting as much as possible of\npython into 64K of RAM and ROM, and some interesting things I learnt\nabout python along the way. If you already know a lot about compilers\nthen this may be the talk for you, as it's not every day you have to fit\na compiler into such limited RAM, and such a limited instruction set.",
