  "description": "Programming languages and libraries are proliferating in the data science community. In an effort to reduce communication barriers and enable automation and intelligent tooling, we are developing software to automatically construct language-agnostic semantic models of data science code written in Python or R. In this talk, we introduce our methods and illustrate them by example.",
