  "description": "Abstract\n\nMany people think of neural networks as magic boxes, using them as such\nis similar to allowing the computer or the machine to have a mind of\ntheir own. Classification and prediction are the best-known applications\nof these algorithms. But it has been demonstrated that they can also be\nused in multiple creative or artistic ways such as generating pictures,\nmusical pieces, humour based dialogues or jokes and plays or literary\npieces. Leading to the following question: can these black boxes express\ntrue creativity? A trait commonly associated with humans.\n\nDescription\n\nAlgorithmic Art (or computer generated art) refers to the use of\ncomputer algorithms to create artistic pieces. Algorithmic art has been\naround from the early 1960s, when artists used a plotter controlled by a\ncomputer to create some visual artwork pieces. In the 80s when computer\ngraphics became more accessible, digital fractal artworks dominated to\nbecome the mainstream of algorithmic art. By the end of the 80s, genetic\nalgorithms had matured enough to have a major influence in the\nalgorithmic composition of music. At the same time, the artificial\nneural networks were used to explore the creation of musical\ncompositions. Most recently, thanks to the blooming of neural network\nframeworks (e.g. tensorflow), availability of GPUs and development in\nsophisticated neural network architecture, they play an important part\nin academic research and data science business applications. Besides\nthat, these enhanced resources and frameworks have enabled the neural\nnetworks to make significant contributions in the area of Algorithmic\nArts. Examples of this are the Deep Dream and artistic style transfer\nand GANs (generative adversarial network) which can generate highly\ndeceptive pictures. A specially trained neural network is also capable\nof composing music mimicking the style of Beethoven or generating a\nmodern music piece. In the same way, a neural network can be used to\ngenerate poems or literary pieces in the true style of Shakespeare or\nHamilton. In this talk, we will go through a gallery of art and music\ncreated by algorithms, showcasing what roles computers took in different\nalgorithmic art forms. From the earliest fractal art to the music and\npictures generated by the state of the art neural networks and GANs.\nThis talk is suitable for everyone, from the curious general public to\nexperts in the field of neural networks, both will find this talk\ninspiring and amusing.\n\n-  Slide for this talk:\n   https://slides.com/cheukting\\_ho/ai-and-algorithmic-art/live#/\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1778\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 3 May** at 11:15 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
