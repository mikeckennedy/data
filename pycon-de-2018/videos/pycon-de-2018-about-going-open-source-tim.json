  "description": "I will start of talking about why \"working for free\" became an important\npart of the developer culture all around the world and talk about why\ncompanies should try to share as many tools as possible. I'll give some\nexamples of tools that were open sourced and got immense traction\nleading to the projects growing with an intense speed. I'll try to take\naway the \"fear\" of open sourcing tools that cost ten of thousands of\ndollars to create. Then I'll describe how my journey with open source\nlooks like and start talking about how you can get your feet into\ncontributing to known projects. After that I will close off with some\nhints on doing and contributing to open source projects that worked out\ngreat for me. They will also get an impression on what opportunities\nwill show up if they put some of their time into doing OS.\n\nThe audience can be mixed, but it's way more interesting for people that\nare either new to programming or have never worked with open source.\n\nIn a perfect world, some of the listeners would leave the presentation\nwith the motivation and hard goal to start with OS as soon as possible.\n",
