  "description": "Every day, the amount of data we store increases dramatically. Users demand high availability and low latency from the machines where it is stored. Single machines are prone to failure, and in many cases can't cope with high traffic demands. Distributed systems have become an increasingly common solution for these problems. They offer fault tolerance and resilience while allowing users to interact with what appears to be a single machine.\n\nThe talk is intended for people who are curious about distributed systems and who would like a better understanding of how they work. Attendees will come away with an understanding of the problem of consensus, what problems consensus algorithms solve, and how the Raft algorithm works.",
