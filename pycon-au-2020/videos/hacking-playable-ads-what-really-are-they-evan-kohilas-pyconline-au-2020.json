Are they running code? \r\nIf they are, can we hijack them?\r\nIf we can't, can we bypass, or even replace them?\r\n\r\nAnd more importantly, what are they actually doing?\r\nAre you really playing a game? Or are they bitcoin miners in disguise?\r\n\r\nCome along and join my adventurous curiosity as we learn to man in the middle these ads and discover what they're really about!\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 13:55:00 2020 at Python 2",
