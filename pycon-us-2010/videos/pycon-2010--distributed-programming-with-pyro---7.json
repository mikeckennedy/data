  "description": "Distributed Programming with Pyro\n\nPresented by Alfredo Deza\n\nCreate distributed code that communicates trivially over the network\nwith objects that answer as if they were local.\n\nSend, receive and manage data with this powerful library. Presentation\nwill include real life example for restarting a load balanced web\ninstance running two Apache web servers and a MySQL database.\n\nAlthough Python allows you to perform simple network operations, Pyro\ncreates a nice layer between core networking essentials and your code,\nallowing you to concentrate more in developing your application.\n",
