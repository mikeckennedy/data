  "description": "\"Although people of all genders can experience violence and abuse\nonline, the abuse experienced by women is often sexist or misogynistic\nin nature, and online threats of violence against women are often\nsexualized and include specific references to women\u2019s bodies. \" -\nAmnesty International. This abuse pushes women offline, affecting their\nsocial well-being, representation and economic potential.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss how we plan to help resolve this with our\nbrowser extension, Opt Out. I will discuss the online global tragedy\nthat is online sexual harassment, our idea and where we\u2019re at with\ncurrent implementation. I will also talk about what it\u2019s like to build\nan open source activism project, one which aims to be lead by the\ncommunity it\u2019s trying to protect.\n\nWe will cover current research and results from our own engagement with\nthe community, where the idea came from and challenges we have faced and\nplan to face in the future. I will also dive into the intricate world of\nnatural language processing (NLP) for online harassment and talk about\nbalancing state-of-the-art data science with web development in an open\nsource community, one being managed by someone relatively new to tech.",
