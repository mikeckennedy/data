  "description": "This introductory workshop assumes no prior exposure to Julia. It should\nbe accessible (and hopefully useful!) to scientists, engineers, and\nanyone else with technical computing needs. We will show you why Julia\nis special, demonstrate how easy it is to come to Julia from a Python\nbackground, and get you writing your first Julia programs. We will\nprovide an overview of Julia\u2019s syntax, core language features such as\nmultiple dispatch, standard library functionality, and package system.\nShort interactive exercises woven throughout the tutorial will reinforce\nall topics we cover, and afterwards we will integrate your new skills\nvia hands-on exploration of a few applications.Presenter(s): Speaker:\nJane Herriman, Director of Diversity and Outreach , Julia Computing\nSpeaker: Sacha Verweij, Stanford University\n",
