  "description": "| Nowadays everyone wants to bring Agile Best Practices into all the\n  teams, but it's a hard task to implement it and adapt based on\n  different teams. Setting up all necessary Agile meetings and using\n  buzz words is not enough for the team to be happy and successful while\n  working in Agile environment.\n| Inspired by the \"Divine Comedy\" by Dante Alighieri, I decided to\n  create a short guide into Agile best practices. It will guide through\n  Failures, Challenges to the Success in building a happy dream team!\n| This talk is divided into three parts:\n| 1. Failures in setting up Agile processes for a team.\n| 2. Challenges on the way to happy and successful team.\n| 3. Successful examples how to have happy and productive Agile team and\n  constantly deliver a great product.",
