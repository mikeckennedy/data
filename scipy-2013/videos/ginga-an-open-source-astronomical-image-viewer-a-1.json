  "summary": "Authors: Jeschke, Eric, Subaru Telescope, National Astronomical\nObservatory of Japan\n\nTrack: Astronomy and Astrophysics\n\nGinga is a new astronomical image viewer written in python. It uses and\ninter-operates with several key scientific python packages: numpy,\npyfits, and scipy. A key differentiator for this image viewer, compared\nto older-generation FITS viewers, is that all the key components are\nwritten as python classes, allowing for the first time a powerful FITS\nimage display widget to be directly embedded in, and tightly coupled\nwith, python code.\n\nWe call Ginga a toolkit for programming FITS viewers because it includes\na choice of base classes for programming custom viewers for two\ndifferent modern widget sets: Gtk and Qt, available on the three common\ndesktop platforms. In addition, a reference viewer is included with the\nsource code based on a plugin architecture in which the viewer can be\nextended with plugins scripted in python. The code is released under a\nBSD license similar to other major python packages and is available on\ngithub.\n\nGinga has been introduced only recently as a tool to the astronomical\ncommunity, but since SciPy has a developer focus this talk concentrates\non programming with the Ginga toolkit. We cover two cases: using the\nbare image widget to build custom viewers and writing plugins for the\nexisting full-featured Ginga viewer. The talk may be of interest to\nanyone developing code in python needing to display scientific image\n(CCD or CMOS) data and astronomers interested in python-based quick look\nand analysis tools.\n",
