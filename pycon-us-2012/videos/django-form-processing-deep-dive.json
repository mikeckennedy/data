  "summary": "Django Form processing often takes a back seat to flashier, more visible\nparts of the framework. But Django forms, fully leveraged, can help\ndevelopers be more productive and write more cohesive code. This talk\nwill dive deep into the stock Django forms package, as well as discuss a\nstrategy for abstracting validation for forms, and the use of unit and\nintegration tests with forms.\n",
