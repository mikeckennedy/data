  "description": "This talk is about several approaches to implement high performing\nnumerical algorithms and applications in Python. It introduces into\napproaches like multi-threading, parallelization (CPU/GPU), dynamic\ncompiling, high throughput IO operations.\n\nThe approach is a practical one in that every approach is illustrated by\nspecific Python examples.\n\nThe talk uses, among others, the following libraries:\n\n-  NumPy\n-  numexpr\n-  IPython.Parallel\n-  Numba\n-  NumbaPro\n-  PyTables\n\n",
