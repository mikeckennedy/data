  "description": "This talk will aim to demystify quantum computing and will assume no\nprior knowledge. The speaker, while having studied Quantum Field Theory\nmany years ago, has only relatively recently started learning properly\nabout Quantum Computing, and is going to try to take advantage of the\nfact that the ideas are relatively new to him to explain the key\nconcepts simply, to an audience (probably) consisting mostly of\nnon-experts in quantum computing.\n\nKey questions I will try to cover are likely to include \\* What is\nquantum mechanics anyway? \\* What are quantum computers? Are they real?\nAnd are they really faster/more powerful than classical computers? \\*\nWhat is a qubit (the quantum computing analogue of a bit) \\* What\nproblems are likely to be solved well by quantum computers? \\* How do\nyou program a quantum computer? \\* How do you get results out of a\nquantum computer? What kind of results are they anyway? Do you have to\nvisit other universes to get them? \\* Can you get access to quantum\ncomputers online and use Python to program them (kind-of!) \\* Will\nquantum computers break all encryption? \\* What are Shor\u2019s and Grover\u2019s\nalgorithms and (just possibly) how do they work? \\* What are the\nchallenges with building practical quantum computers? \\* What is the\nPython story with Quantum Computing?\n",
