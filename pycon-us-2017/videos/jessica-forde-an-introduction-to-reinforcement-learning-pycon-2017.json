  "description": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning focused on\nbuilding agents: software that can robustly achieve a desired objective\nunder varying states of the world. This introduction will provide you\nwith an overview of RL and tools to build your own agents. In this talk,\nwe will provide an overview of terminology in reinforcement learning and\na Jupyter Notebook outlining basic algorithms to learn 'policies',\nstrategies for an agent, and visualize them with numpy, pandas, and\nseaborn. Newer developments in reinforcement learning apply deep\nlearning to improve performance. We will further discuss deep\nreinforcement learning and how to use deep learning libraries, such as\nTensorFlow or Theano, with the latest RL libraries: `OpenAI\nGym <https://gym.openai.com>`__, `OpenAI\nUniverse <https://universe.openai.com>`__, and `DeepMind\nLab <https://github.com/deepmind/lab>`__.\n",
