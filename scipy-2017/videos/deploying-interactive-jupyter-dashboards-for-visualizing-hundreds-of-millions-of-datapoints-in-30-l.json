  "description": "It can be difficult to assemble the right set of packages from the Python scientific software ecosystem to solve complex problems. This presentation will show step by step how to make and deploy a concise, fast, and fully reproducible recipe for interactive visualization of millions or billions of datapoints using very few lines of Python in a Jupyter notebook using a combination of the HoloViews, Datashader, Dask, Bokeh and paramNB libraries and deployed as a Jupyter Dashboard.",
