  "description": "So you've learned about the data analytics capabilities of Python, and now you're ready to start churning through data -- great! But do you know how to turn your snippet of code into a system capable of taking in streams of raw sensor data and spitting out insights? This presentation will lay out the basic components of a Python-based data pipeline built for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, and will highlight some of the common challenges associated with putting together an efficient data analytics and storage system.\n\nKey topics include:\n\n\u2022 An overview of cloud-based \"serverless\" data pipelines;\n\n\u2022 Pros and cons of locally-hosted or \"edge computing\" systems;\n\n\u2022 Tradeoffs between cost, scalability, complexity, and development time for different architectures\n\nBy the end of this presentation, you will have gained a broad overview of the ecosystem needed to support a Python analytics solution: how to get data in and out, how to write and deploy scalable code, and how to manage system cost and complexity.",
