  "description": "Tools to make your data analysis and machine learning both easier and more reliable\n\n| The wrong way to start your machine learning project is to \u201cchuck\n  everything into a model to see what happens\u201d. The better way is to\n  visualise your data to expose the relationships that you expect, to\n  confirm that your data looks correct and to identify problems that are\n  likely to make your life difficult.\n| We\u2019ll review ways to quickly and visually diagnose your data, to check\n  it meets your assumptions and to prepare it for discussion with your\n  colleagues. We\u2019ll look at tools including Pandas, Seaborn and Pandas\n  Profiling. At the end you\u2019ll have new tools to help you confidently\n  investigate new data with your associates.",
