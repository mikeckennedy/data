  "description": "(Christopher Neugebauer) What is a decorator? You might say it's a function that accepts a function and returns a function. That's wrong.\r\n\r\nSo what's the right answer?\r\n\r\nJoin us for a deep (but standard talk-length) dive into decorators!  You\u2019ll learn what decorators actually are, how they work, how to write your own decorators, and how decorators enable you to do extremely weird things in Python. Most importantly, you\u2019ll understand how to use decorators responsibly, and definitely not to confuse your friends and colleagues.\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country\u2019s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nSat Sep 11 10:30:00 2021 at Platypus Hall",
