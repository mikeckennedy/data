  "description": "The data transformation code you're writing is correct, but potentially\n1000x slower than it needs to be! In this talk, we will go over multiple\nways to enhance a data transformation workflow with Pandas and Numpy by\nshowing how to replace slower, perhaps more familiar, ways of operating on\nPandas data frames with faster-vectorized solutions to common use cases\nlike:\n\n* if-else logic in applied row-wise functions\n* dictionary lookups with conditional logic\n* Date comparisons and calculations\n* Regex and string column manipulation\n* and others! ...\n\n\nwithout needing a beefier computer, writing Cython, or other libraries\noutside the Pandas ecosystem.",
