  "description": "In this talk I will show how we developed a neural network model in Python to forecast train delays in real-time. Based on the history of delays in the surrounding network we can predict the future expected delay at different points in the network.\n\nBuilding on the excellent machine learning and deep learning tech stack of Python (Keras, TensorFlow and Pandas) I will show how to implement and train a sequence prediction model and work with time series data.",
