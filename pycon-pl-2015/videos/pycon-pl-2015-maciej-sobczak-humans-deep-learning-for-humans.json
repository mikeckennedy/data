  "description": "I invite you on a fascinating journey through the world of deep learning during which with the help of python we will attempt to understand: - what does learning really mean? - how one can define learning? - when one can say that something was successfully learned? - how one can use deep learning for features discovery? - how to debug, test, design and use deep learning algorithms? - what are the areas in which deep learning is being used? - how can you use deep learning in your projects? But most importantly armed with the knowledge about the deep learning we will address the questions about the nature of what's learnable, learnablity of the world around us and finally using the findings of computer science we will try to understand the way our brains learn and how one can leverage that knowledge to improve one's own learning habits and the way learning process could be organised to improve it.",
