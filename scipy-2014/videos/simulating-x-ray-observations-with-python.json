  "description": "X-ray astronomy is a rapidly expanding field, thanks to the many\nobservations of existing observatories, such as *Chandra* and\n*XMM-Newton*, and the anticipation of high-resolution spectral data from\nupcoming missions such as *Astro-H* and *Athena+*. Understanding these\nobservations and connecting them to astrophysical mechanisms requires\nnot only detailed modeling of the underlying physics but reliable\nreproduction of the observed phenomena. I present a method of creating\nsynthetic X-ray observations from numerical simulations, which leverages\nseveral astronomical Python libraries, including\n`yt <http://yt-project.org%20\"yt\">`__,\n`AstroPy <http://www.astropy.org%20\"AstroPy\">`__, and\n`PyXspec <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/python/html/%20\"PyXspec\">`__.\nI will describe the method of generating the observations, the Python\npackages used, and applications of the method, including connecting\nobservations of galaxy clusters with MHD simulations and preparing\nsimulations for observation proposals.\n",
