  "description": "Telenovelas are beloved for their over the top drama and intricate plot\ntwists. In this talk, we\u2019ll review popular telenovelas to synthesize a\ntypical telenovela arc and use it to train a deep learning model.\n\nWhat would a telenovela script look like as imagined by a neural\nnetwork? To answer this question, we\u2019ll examine three Python deep\nlearning frameworks - Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow - to determine the\nprocess of translating a telenovela into a neural network and ultimately\ndetermine which one will be best for the task at hand. Be prepared for\namor, pasi\u00f2n, and y el misterioso!\n",
