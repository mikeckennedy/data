  "description": "I love Pokemon. However, I don't love how some players make the\ncommunity less welcoming towards beginners by hiding their strategies.\nSo I did what any defiant engineer would. I signed up for a free AWS\naccount and began (responsibly) scraping millions of their\nunauthenticated Pokemon battles.\n\nWe'll journey together through this passion project of mine and draw on\nspecific examples to better understand the trade-offs of working with\ndistributed systems or microservice architectures in the cloud.\n",
