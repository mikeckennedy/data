  "description": "The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the pandas data analysis library to work with geographic objects and spatial operations.\n\nIt combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely, providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to shapely. It further builds upon the capabilities of many other libraries including fiona (reading/writing data), pyproj (projections), rtree (spatial index), ... GeoPandas enables you to easily do operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database such as PostGIS.",
