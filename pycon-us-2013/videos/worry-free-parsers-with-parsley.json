  "summary": "Writing parsers has often been a task difficult for programmers to take\non. Many of the tools available for parsing require writing grammar\nrules and code that work very different from everything else in Python.\nParsley is a library that mixes the benefits of concise rule-based\ngrammars with a parsing model that works the way you expect Python code\nto work.\n",
