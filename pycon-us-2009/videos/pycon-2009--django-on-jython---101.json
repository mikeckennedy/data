  "description": "[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: house audio] Django is the most popular Python web\nframework, and the final release of Jython 2.5 should be available a\ncouple of months before PyCon. This means we can now use a modern Python\nweb framework on top of Java infrastructure by running Django on Jython.\nIn this talk, we will show examples of how to use this combination,\nengage a discussion about what can take the Python (and Django)\ncommunity from the Java world, especially the necessary infrastructure\nbits, and how a Django/Jython stack compares with other JVM web stacks\nlike JRuby on Rails.\n",
