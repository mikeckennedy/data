  "description": "Python is graced with flexible, easy to use data structures that are at\nyour fingertips every time you start a command prompt. Lists,\ndictionaries and tuples are our friends. However, sometimes you want\nmore than what they can give.\n\nWhile subclassing is a great approach, often what you want has already\nbeen written. Most often, it\u2019ll be waiting for you within the standard\nlibrary. This talk will be a tour of some of what awaits you. Don\u2019t be\nthe next person to recreate an ordered dictionary.\n\nWithin the collections module, as well as other places within the\nstandard library, you\u2019ll find lots of functionality. Using these data\nstructures can lead to simpler, more robust code.\n\nAs well as explaining how to use some of the data structures that we\nencounter, we\u2019ll also be checking through open source code to see how\nthey are used in the real world. This will give us insight into how\nother programmers are using them. Hopefully\n",
