  "summary": "The Production of a Multi-Resolution Global Index for Geographic\nInformation Systems\n\nAuthors: MacManus, Kytt, Columbia University CIESIN\n\nTrack: GIS - Geospatial Data Analysis\n\nIn order to efficiently access geographic information at the pixel\nlevel, at a global scale, it is useful to develop an indexing system\nwith nested location information. Considering a 1 sq. km image\nresolution, the number of global pixels covering land exceeds 200\nmillion. This talk will summarize the steps taken to produce a global\nmulti-resolution raster indexing system using the Geospatial Data\nAbstraction Library (GDAL) 1.9, and NumPy. The implications of\npresenting this data to a user community reliant on Microsoft Office\ntechnologies will also be discussed.\n",
