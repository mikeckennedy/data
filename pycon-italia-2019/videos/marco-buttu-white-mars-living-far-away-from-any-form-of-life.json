  "description": "Concordia Station is a French/Italian facility located inside\nAntarctica, in a plateau called Dome-C, in the middle of nowhere. A dark\nand cold place: no Sun from May to August, temperatures around -80\nCelsius degress, no life. In this weird place there is a lack of oxygen,\nextremely dry air and no way to go back to the \u201cnormal world\u201d between\nFebruary and November. I lived in Concordia for 13 months, performing\nscientific research with other 12 collegues from Italy, France and\nAustria. We were the most isolated people on Earth, more than the\naustronauts on the International Space Station. It was like living on\nanother planet, and that is why the European Space Agency was making\nbio-medical research on us, in order to understand how the human body\nbehaves in a such extraterrestrial environment. In this talk I will\nintroduce our studies, describe Concordia and our life there, and of\ncourse also speak about Python.\n\nSlides: https://marco-buttu.github.io/white\\_mars/\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1802\n\nin \\_\\_on **Sunday 5 May** at 15:45 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
