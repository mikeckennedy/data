We recommend listening to the tutorial without headphones to minimize the buzzing sound.\nTutorial information may be found at https://scipy2017.scipy.org/ehome/220975/493423/\n\nIn this tutorial, we will cover the fundamentals and practical aspects of network science and how it can be used to solve problems in science and society! Outline:\n\nPart 1: Introduction (30 min)\n\n- Networks of all kinds: biological, transportation.\n- Representation of networks, NetworkX data structures\n- Basic quick-and-dirty visualizations\n\nPart 2: Hubs and Paths (40 min)\n\n- Finding important nodes; applications\n- Pathfinding algorithms and their applications\n- Hands-on: implementing path-finding algorithms\n- Visualize degree and betweenness centrality distributions.\n\nPart 3: Cliques, Triangles & Structures (40 min)\n\n- Definition of cliques\n- Triangles as the simplest complex clique, applications\n- Using path-finding algorithms to find structures in a graph.\n- Open triangles as recommender systems.\n\nPart 4: Bipartite Graphs (30 min)\n\n- Definition of bipartite graphs, applications\n- Constructing bipartite graphs in NetworkX.\n- Summary statistics of bipartite graphs\n\nPart 5: Advanced Network Visualizations & Concepts (40 min)\n\n- Basic concepts in rational layouts: node positioning, node colouring.\n- Plots: Circos, Arc, Hive, Matrix, Flow plots\n- Handling large graphs using matrices.\n- Graph diffs and their application to analysis of time-variant, evolving graphs.",
