As the popularity of the project grows, it also grows the number\nof projects that depend or interact with pandas.\n\nThis talk will cover this ecosystem of projects around pandas, mainly in\nthe prespective of scalability and performance. Discussing for example\nhow projects like Arrow are key for the future of pandas, or how Dask is\novercoming pandas limitations.\n\nIn a first part, the talk will focus on pandas itself, its components,\nand its architecture. This will give the required context for a second\npart, that will explain related projects, how they interact with pandas,\nand what the whole ecosystem can offer to users.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1613\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 3 May** at 12:00 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
