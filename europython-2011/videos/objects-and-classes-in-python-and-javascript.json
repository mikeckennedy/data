  "description": "Python has a well-thought out system for classes. Beginners can use it\nwithout understanding it all. Experts can use it to produce code that is\nboth elegant and powerful (such as models and class-based views in\nDjango). Python classes can be used for many purposes.\n\nThis tutorial arises from the author's experience in using classes to\nsolve problems, such as:\n\n-  Add custom methods and attributes to objects that are, at root, just an integer\n-  Construct dictionaries whose values are functions\n-  Construct classes on-the-fly\n-  Implement JavaScript object semantics in Python (advanced topic)\n\nThe outline syllabus is:\n\n-  Review of the class statement in Python (and decorators)\n-  Subclassing built-in types such as int and tuple\n-  How to define classes without using a class statement\n-  How to define a dispatch dictionary using a class statement\n-  Metaclasses as syntactic sugar for class construction\n-  Metaclasses to provide new class semantics\n-  Review of JavaScript object semantics\n-  Using Python classes to implement JavaScript object semantics\n\nFor Guido on the history of Python classes see:\n\n-  http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/new-style-classes.html\n-  http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/inside-story-on-new-style-classes.html\n-  http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/method-resolution-order.html\n\nThis tutorial is for Intermediate or Advanced Python programmers.\n(Beginners will find it very hard going.) The aim of the course is to\nexplain exactly what happens when a class in constructed, and to learn\nways of using this knowledge.\n",
