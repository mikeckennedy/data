  "description": "One of the nicest things about Python community, is the availability of mentors willing to help you. Various mentors have helped me navigate the open source community and help advanced my skills. I realized finding a mentor is not as easy as it seems, and it takes a lot of courage to reach out in the first place. And then, there is impostor syndrome, where one may feel like they don't deserve the help.\nIn this talk, I will provide advice about working with mentor.\nAsking for help is not a failure.",
