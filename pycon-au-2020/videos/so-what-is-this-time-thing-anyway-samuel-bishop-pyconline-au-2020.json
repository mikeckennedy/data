  "description": "Samuel Bishop\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/DDCVAM\n\nThis is a whirlwind tour of modern timekeeping. From the weird and wonderful timekeeping of astronomers, to what goes into the normal civil time you read on your watch. With fun stops through calendaring, atomic clocks, GPS, space probes, and more along the way! As programmers, we work with dates and times on a regular basis and while most of us will never come across a TAI timestamp, or convert from UTC to TCB, there is a rich history behind our modern timekeeping with all its wonderful acronyms. Regardless of your level of skill or familiarity with timekeeping, I hope you can get something out of this introduction to timekeeping, illustrated with Python where applicable.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 14:40:00 2020 at Obvious",
