  "description": "Data science demands the interactive exploration of large volumes of\ndata, combined with computationally intensive algorithms and analytics.\nToday, the computational limits of CPUs are being realized, and a new\napproach is needed. We will discuss how the GPU Open Analytics\nInitiative is breaking the compute barrier with GPU-accelerated\nlibraries such as PyGDF and accelerating data science.\n",
