  "description": "The state-of-the-art in image classification has skyrocketed thanks\nto the development of deep convolutional neural networks and\nincreases in the amount of data and computing power available to\ntrain them. The top-5 error rate in the international ImageNet\ncompetition to predict which of 1000 classes an image belongs to has\nplummeted from 28% error in 2010 before deep learning to just 2.25%\nin 2017 (human level error is around 5%).\n\nIn addition to being able to classify objects in images (including not\nhotdogs), deep learning can be used to automatically generate captions\nfor images, convert photos into paintings, detect cancer in pathology\nslide images, and help self-driving cars \u2018see\u2019.\n\nThe talk will give an overview of the cutting edge in the field and some\nof the core mathematical concepts behind the models. It will also\ninclude a short code-first tutorial to show how easy it is to get\nstarted using deep learning for computer vision in python\u2026\n",
