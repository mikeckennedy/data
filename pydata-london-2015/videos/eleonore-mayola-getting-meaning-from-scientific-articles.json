  "description": "The bibliography process means every scientist regularly has to go\nthrough a lot of published articles in parallel to her/his research. The\naim is to:\n\n- know what other researchers are doing: they might be ahead\n  of you, they might have proven your project is a dead end.\n- get some context to interpret your research results.\n\nUsing specialised search engines can be inefficient if you don't use\nthe \"right\" keywords. Researcher also tend to find bibliography\nboring so it would be interesting to automate part of the process!\n\nIn my talk I'll answer the following question:\n\n- can Python machine learning libraries (nltk, scikit-learn) be used\n  to determine whether a research article is worth reading?\n\nI'll use the TF-IDF measure to identify frequent topics appearing in\nspecific scientific articles and train a classifier to distinguish\nbetween relevant and non-relevant articles depending and someone's\ninterests.\n",
