  "description": "\"On the internet, fraudulent and abusive behavior is considered\nespecially heinous. At Heroku, the dedicated detectives who investigate\nthese vicious felonies are members of an elite squad armed with large\namounts of data and spare CPU cycles. These are their stories.\"\n\nBad behavior can wreak havoc on your web application. It might be\nmass-signups, fraudulent orders, spammy posts, right up to automated\nbots designed to work around restrictions you have set in place; this\ncan cost you time, resources, and lots of money. All is not lost though.\nDespite the ongoing efforts of abusers, their activity still leaves\nfingerprints and clues, which you can use to your advantage.\n\nThis talk is a 101 introduction to some of the methods which you can use\nto separate good from bad users using a combination of data mining,\nstatistics, and some some basic machine learning. Basically, I want to\nget you thinking like an internet detective.\n\nSome of the topics I will be covering include:\n\n-  Collecting and preparing data sources.\n-  Effective methods for classifying existing users.\n-  Feature extracting; what works and what doesn't.\n-  Analyzing user-provided data to profile your users, and weed out the\n   bad operators.\n-  Determining a user's intentions by looking at their access patterns.\n-  Making use of 'outliers' to find suspicious users and transactions.\n-  Stopping bad users before they can wreak havoc.\n\nAs this is a 101 topic I will provide some basic examples, as well as\nlinks to more in-depth resources for further reading. I would recommend\nthis talk to developers of web applications, especially those with a\nlarge number of users, the ability to process credit cards, or with a\n'free' offering. Attendees should have a basic understanding of topics\nsuch as SQL, Pandas, and some basic understanding of mathematics and\nstatistics, although this is not essential as I will be providing links\nto further reading.\n",
