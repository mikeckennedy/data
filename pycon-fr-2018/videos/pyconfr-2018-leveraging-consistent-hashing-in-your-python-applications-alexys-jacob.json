  "description": "While consistent hashing is largely known and adopted in the NoSQL\ndatabase clusters to solve data distribution and data access\nreliability, it is less known and used by the typical developers.\n\nThis talk will introduce you to consistent hashing and the problems it\nsolves while going through a practical use case in a python application.\n\nWe will start from its standalone design and scale it out to an\noptimized clustered version thanks to consistent hashing.\n",
