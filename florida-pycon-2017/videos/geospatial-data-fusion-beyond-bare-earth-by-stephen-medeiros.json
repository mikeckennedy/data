  "description": "Point clouds make for compelling 3D imagery, but there\u2019s real\nengineering information in there too! See what we are mining out of\nairborne laser scanning data to enhance the resilience of coastal\ncommunities. Dr. Stephen Medeiros, a lecturer in Civil Engineering at\nthe University of Central Florida, describes his team\u2019s work in\nGeospatial Data Fusion for coastal resilience. Dr. Medeiros uses\nairborne laser scanning data (aka lidar) to characterize surface\nroughness for use in computer models for hurricane storm surge. All of\nhis students are required to learn and apply Python to their data\nscience tasks such as ETL, machine learning, and statistical analysis of\na variety of environmental data such as wind speeds, water levels, and\n3D laser scanning point clouds. By describing the coastal floodplain in\nintricate detail, Dr. Medeiros and his students study how the roughness\nof the landscape influence hurricane winds and storm surge behavior.\nThis work is carried out on the STOKES HPC at the Advanced Research\nComputing Center in UCF\u2019s Institute for Simulation and Training.",
