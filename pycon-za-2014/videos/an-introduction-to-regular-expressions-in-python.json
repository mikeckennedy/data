  "summary": "Regular expressions are a mini-language used for pattern-matching in\ntext. They have been a staple of the computing world for decades: they\nare implemented in most programming languages, form the core of several\nutilities, and can be found lurking in the search-and-replace\nfunctionality of any sufficiently advanced text editor. Despite their\nusefulness, regular expressions have developed a reputation for\ncomplexity and a steep learning curve. New programmers are often warned\nto steer clear of them -- which is a pity, because there are some\nproblems for which they are a quick and elegant solution. In this talk I\naim to demystify regular expressions for the beginner programmer, and to\nprovide a brief guided tour of Python's re module. I hope to encourage\nmore programmers to get to know this useful tool.\n",
