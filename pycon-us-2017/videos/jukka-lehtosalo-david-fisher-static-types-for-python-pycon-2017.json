  "description": "Over the past year and a half, Dropbox has been investing in the\ndevelopment of mypy, a static type checker for Python, as a way to make\nour multimillion-line Python codebase easier to understand, navigate,\nand maintain. In this talk, we will discuss the benefits of type\nannotations, explain how to use them, and give a peak into how mypy\nworks behind the scenes.\n\nMypy is an open-source type-checker for Python which supports the PEP\n484 standard for gradual typing. Originally created by Jukka Lehtosalo\nas part of his PhD thesis in 2013, it is now under active development by\na small team at Dropbox which includes David Fisher, Greg Price, and\nGuido van Rossum. It supports Python 3.2 and higher, as well as Python\n2.7 (via type comments).\n",
