  "description": "There has been a massive interest in reproducible research / data\nanalysis pipelines over the last few years.\nBut... how can I ensure that what I produce as a Python\nuser is reproducible?\nIn this tutorial we'll be taking you on a journey down the rabbit hole\nof reproducibility.\nWe'll be taking a step by step approach to reproducible scientific development\nin Python.\nThis means you get a crash course on version control, execution environments, testing,\nand continuous integration. And a guide on how to integrate all of these in your\nsoftware projects.\nBy the end of the course we hope you will have the necessary tools to make your\nPython workflows reproducible no matter if you're starting a brand new project\nor if this is ready to be shared with the world.",
