  "description": "Using the recent Home Depot Search Relevance Kaggle competition\n(https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-depot-product-search-relevance) as an\nexample, this talk will give a general overview of a predictive\nanalytics project in python, specifically focusing on text analytics.\nThis talk will first give an introduction to Kaggle and this\ncompetition in particular. To give an introduction to predictive\nanalytics, I will then show how to start designing \"features\" which\ndescribe the similarity of two samples of text. Using a very simple\nfeature, the number of overlapping words, we can build our first\nsimple predictive model. Building on this base, we'll then explore\nmore advanced text mining techniques, such as term frequency matrices,\nTF-IDF, Latent Semantic Analysis, and word2vec. Finally, we can see\nhow the final random forest model performs and what the most important\nfeatures were.\n\nI've delivered this presentation in 30 minutes at a work event\nalready. I can tweak the talk to focus less on the introduction to\npredictive analytics and more on the text analytics methods if that\nwould be a better fit for the audience.\n",
