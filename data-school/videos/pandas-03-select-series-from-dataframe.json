  "description": "DataFrames and Series are the two main object types in pandas for data storage: a DataFrame is like a table, and each column of the table is called a Series. You will often select a Series in order to analyze or manipulate it. In this video, I'll show you how to select a Series using \"bracket notation\" and \"dot notation\", and will discuss the limitations of dot notation. I'll also demonstrate how to create a new Series in a DataFrame.\n\nThis is video 3 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
