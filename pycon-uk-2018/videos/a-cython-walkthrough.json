  "description": "Speed up your Python and link it with C\n\nCython is a tool that can convert regular Python modules, or Python with\nsome additional syntax, into C extension modules that can be imported\nfrom regular Python code.\n\nThis provides a significant speed improvement on most code, and\nadditionally allows the direct use of C functions within your code.\n\nIn this talk I plan to run through three use cases for Cython and how\nthese have helped me in projects that are either speed-sensitive or need\nto intermix with external C projects.\n\nThe talk should be suitable for anyone with good basic knowledge of\nregular Python or better -- cursory knowledge of C is useful but not\nneeded.",
