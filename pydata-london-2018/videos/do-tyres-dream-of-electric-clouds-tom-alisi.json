  "abstract": "Tyres are the only physical connection between a car and the road, and\nhave traditionally been the least connected part of increasingly complex\nvehicles, until now.\n\nConnesso is an IoT product that provides the driver with information on\nthe tyre operating conditions by exploiting a set of sensors mounted in\nthe Pirelli tyres tread groove.\n\nThe on-board sensors report pressure, temperature, and load data to the\nPirelli cloud via a receiver unit connected with bluetooth to a mobile\napp.\n\nReal-time analytics and visualization of available data enable the\nsystem to report tyre consumption, residual mileage, maintenance status\nand potential breakdowns.\n\nFor the first time in history, tyres have a voice. Do they also have\ndreams?\n",
