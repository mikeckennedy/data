  "description": "What\u2019s Python like? Is it ready for the \u201centerprise\u201d? Does it scale well\nin the \u201ccloud\u201d? How does it stand against its old, bearded enemies like\nJava, or new threats like Ruby? A lot of work on Python is focused on\nthe language itself, making it quite pleasant to read and write, and\ncatering hordes of language lovers that swear by it. Nowadays, though,\nwe don\u2019t just choose a language: we pick a platform - which includes a\nruntime, APIs, and a lot of tools - along with its strengths and\nweaknesses, and many factors should be considered before doing so -\nmostly because we don\u2019t usually have a \u201cbest choice ever\u201d and we must\nface some sort of tradeoff with each design choice. Java is ubiquitous\nin the \u201centerprise software\u201d world despite its cumbersomeness - why? Is\nit really just a matter of slow adoption rate, or does it still stand\nstrong in some fields? We\u2019ll explore where Python already works well and\nwhere it falls beyond others, not just in terms of language beauty, but\nin terms of tools and team productivity. We won\u2019t be able to go really\ndeep into each aspect since time is limited, but questions are welcome.\n",
