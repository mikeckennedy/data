  "description": "Developing a strategy for community building in a project, and ultimately transitioning that project to a peer-supported collaborative enterprise, is an intensely challenging process. This talk will describe some community building strategies, talk about lots of (painful, demoralizing, embarrassing) ways they fall short, and suggest a path forward for projects to collaborate as a meta-community.",
