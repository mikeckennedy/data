  "description": "Hg and Git: Can't we all just get along?\n\nPresented by Scott Chacon\n\nThere is a fair amount of unnecessary animosity between developers about\nversion control systems, especially between Mercurial and Git users. In\nreality, these two systems are very similar and can actually cooperate\npretty well. In this talk we will show just how similar Git and\nMercurial are, look at some of their technical differences, and see how\nthey can work together by looking at hg-git, the bidirectional\nGit/Mercurial bridge, implemented in Python.\n",
