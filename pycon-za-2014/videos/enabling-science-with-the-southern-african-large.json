  "summary": "The Southern African Large Telescope is the premier optical astronomical\nfacility in South Africa. Since the start of science operations in\nSeptember 2011, it has produced a wide range of scientific results from\nstudies of near-Earth asteroids to galaxies at the edge of the Universe.\nOnce observations are obtained at the telescope, they are passed through\nour science pipeline, which is built on Python. The pipeline rapidly\ndistributes the data, provides science quality reductions, and monitors\nthe performance of the telescope. In addition, developments made for\nSALT have also contributed to astropy, a python library for astronomy.\nIn this talk, we highlight how these developments are helping to\ncontribute to our understanding of the Universe. We describe how we are\nusing python to provide rapid reductions of the observations, for\nteaching new students, and for solving new problems.\n",
