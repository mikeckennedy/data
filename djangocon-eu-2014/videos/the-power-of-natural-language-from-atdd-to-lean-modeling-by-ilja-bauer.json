  "description": "Delivering high quality software solutions that meet customer\nexpectations and requirements is the essential goal of any development\nproject. Therefore, development teams need to obtain the relevant domain\nknowledge and information from their customers.\n\nAs a result, initial system specifications are typically formulated\nusing natural language (e.g., within plain text documents). The main\nchallenge imposed by this process is to avoid misunderstandings,\nmisinterpretations and inconsistencies during the transformation of\ninformal requirements into formal specifications, models, and executable\ncode or tests.\n\nAt first the talk will briefly introduce Acceptance Test-Driven\nDevelopment (ATDD) as a powerful method to bridge the gap between\nrequirements engineering and software testing. Following this, the\nsecond part will push the original ATDD idea even further by introducing\nthe concept of \u201cLean Modeling\u201d, a lightweight and pragmatic alternative\nto classical software modeling and DSL tools.\n\nExamples will be presented that illustrate the usage of natural language\nspecifications for various django specific artifacts:\n\n-  models\n-  REST Resources\n-  initial database data (fixtures)\n-  forms.\n\nThis approach can also help to improve our debugging experience and IDE\nsmart completion support. In addition to these advantages during\ndevelopment a demo will be shown, that illustrates how customers / users\ncan benefit from \u201cLean Modeling\u201d by creating custom forms in their\ndjango backend with natural language.\n",
