  "description": "**Audience level**\n\nIntermediate\n\n**Description**\n\nThis talk will contain my opinionated views on several topics,\nincluding, but not limited to:\n\n-  Which areas of testing are well catered for, and which are not?\n-  What sources of bugs are frequent, and very hard to test?\n-  Should we perhaps start talking about unit tests less, and start\n   talking about other forms of testing more?\n\n**Abstract**\n\nIn my day job I spend a lot of time looking at projects that are part of\nUbuntu, and trying to find out why they\u2019re being released with bugs.\nThis in turn leads to a lot of dissection of test suites, and a lot of\ndiscussion with my colleagues around tests, names of tests, why some\ntests are better than others, where the common gaps in test coverage\nare, how applications should be tested, where, when, and why certain\ntest suites should be run, and other subjects too boring to mention.\n\nHaving done this for several years, I've started to form a few troubling\nthoughts about the state of automated testing in software development,\nand in python specifically. When taken together, these can start to form\na rough and ready 'testing philosophy' - a way of looking at code and,\nby analysing it's structure and visibility, start to find gaps in it's\ntest coverage.\n\nThis talk contains no silver bullets - no magical solutions, but does\n(hopefully) contain some interesting questions.\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/thomi-richards-a-testing-talk\n",
