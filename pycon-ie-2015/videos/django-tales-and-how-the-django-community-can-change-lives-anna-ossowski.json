  "description": "The Django and Python communities can change lives and have changed many lives including my own. I\u2019ve been running the Your Django Story interview series on the Django Girls blog for over a year now. So far I featured 70 amazing women who work with Django. In my talk, I will present our interview series and share 8 Django Tales, stories of 8 inspiring women whose lives were changed by learning Python and Django and becoming involved in the Python and Django communities. I will also share what you can do to help Django Girls grow even more.\nIf you\u2019d love to hear inspiring Django Tales, this is the right talk for you :)",
