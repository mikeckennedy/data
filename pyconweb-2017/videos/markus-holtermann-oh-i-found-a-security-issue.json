Let\u2019s look at the history ;-)\n\nWe'll give an insight on how the Django team handles security issues,\u00a0\nwhich can serve as a guideline and followed in own projects. We'll\u00a0\nwill also review the history of Django's security issues to identify\u00a0\nhotspots and areas to look out for.",
