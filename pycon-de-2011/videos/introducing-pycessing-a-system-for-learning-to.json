  "summary": "Python is a great language for teaching beginning programming but, until\nnow, there was no simple integrated system that made it easy to get\nstarted. PyCessing gives new users a simple integrated IDE and basic\nmulti-media functionality that get users going without the distraction\nof complex tools or libraries. It is based on emulating the success that\nProcessing brought to teaching Java.\n",
