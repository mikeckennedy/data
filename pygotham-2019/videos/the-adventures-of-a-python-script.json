  "description": "Have you ever wondered what happens between the time you run helloWorld.py\nand the terminal prints out \u201cHello world\u201d? I will be sharing the wonderful\nand interesting process of how the Python interpreter works from the Python\nsource code to the compilation of bytecode.\n\nSteve Yegge, a programmer and blogger who has a plethora of experience in\noperating systems, once noted the importance about compilers by stating, \u201cIf\nyou don\u2019t know how compilers work, then you don\u2019t know how computers work\u201d.\nThis talk will share an overview of how CPython works from lexxing to\ncompiling as well as how the abstract syntax tree (AST) works. At the end of\nthe talk, you\u2019ll be able to understand the general concept of the abstract\nsyntax tree (AST) and how creating a interpreter can additionally benefit\nyou in ways unrelated to the actual compilation such as linting and\ndebugging.",
