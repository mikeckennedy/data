While interactive plots can provide users more information on interested samples, while audiences have to touch the data for specific samples if only static plots are provided. At present, there are some interactive graphing library in Python, Among them, \"Plotly\" is most popular and strongly supported by community.\n\"Plotly\" company also release \"Dash\" package that can build web-based online plots in pure Python. The needed technique of UI and web are covered by Dash, so you can focus on data manipulation and visualization. It is easy for data scientist to share their analysis on web interface over whole group by Dash. This tutorial will introduce basic usage of Plotly, then, the procedures of building the apps by Dash are described as following layout by \"html\" and \"core\" components, callback to make your apps more interactive, and distributing your apps to Heroku.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QBCLbgaJKH27CqP-6NlwrnCjGk1J3YuLk4GOvOe8lpI/edit?usp=sharing\n\nSpeaker: \u9ec3\u5764\u8ce2\n\n\u76ee\u524d\u5f9e\u4e8b\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u5be6\u9a57\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u548c\u53f0\u7063\u4e4b\u9593\u98db\u4f86\u98db\u53bb\u3002\u559c\u6b61python,C++,shell script\u7b49\u7a0b\u5f0f\u8a9e\u8a00\uff0c\u4e26\u7528python\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u597d\u7d2f\u7684\u535a\u58eb\u8ad6\u6587\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u683d\u9032\u4e86\u7528\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u4f86\u5b8c\u6210\u5be6\u9a57\u6578\u64da\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5751\u6d1e\uff0c\u6e96\u5099\u6316\u53e6\u4e00\u500b\u5e73\u884c\u904b\u7b97\u7684\u5751\u6389\u4e0b\u53bb\u3002\n\u5c08\u9577\u662f\u7761\u904e\u982d\uff0c\u672a\u4f86\u65b9\u5411\u662f\u5c0b\u627e\u4e00\u500b\u53ef\u53eb\u5f97\u9192\u6211\u7684\u9b27\u9418\u3002",
