  "description": "We've used the \"inplace\" parameter many times during this video series, but what exactly does it do, and when should you use it? In this video, I'll explain how \"inplace\" affects methods such as \"drop\" and \"dropna\", and why it is always False by default.\n\nThis is video 20 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
