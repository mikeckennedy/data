  "description": "Have you ever been in a meeting where a colleague says \u201cI\u2019m a great\nsupporter of gender equality, but I\u2019m totally opposed to quotas!\u201d Or, \u201cI\nbelieve in diversity, but I won\u2019t stand for positive discrimination.\u201d\nMaybe you felt a bit troubled by such statements, thinking: that sounds\nfair, but somehow I don\u2019t think it is\u2026 how do I rebut this? We all know\nthat bias is omnipresent in our society, and some of us are keenly aware\nof rampant bias in sectors like technology, engineering and politics.\nEfforts to thwart the effects of bias in communities and institutions\nprompt a spectrum of diversity initiatives. Many times these lead to\nbacklash. It\u2019s been just a year since the memo \"Google's Ideological\nEcho Chamber\u201d spread through the company\u2019s internal channels, before\nbecoming public. Yet, another wrangle already is blasting online with\nthe recent article \"Why Women Don\u2019t Code,\u201d by a university lecturer.\nWhat do we do when privileged individuals continue to turn a blind eye\non the injustices around them? They insist on points like \u201cwomen are\nless likely to choose computer science,\u201d and that\u2019s just due to natural\ndifferences. Community and institution leaders have much of the power to\ncatalyze change, but in the meantime, I want us to build, share and\nrefine a portfolio of rebuttals for the recurring themes of the\nanti-diversity manifestos. Let\u2019s get started.Presenter(s): Speaker:\nLorena Barba, George Washington University\n",
