  "description": "Day 3, R0 11:30\u201312:00\n\nI\u2019ve been using IPython since the beginning of my adventure with Python. Over the years, I've picked up more and more tricks that it could do.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I would like to share some of them with you:\r\n- Documentation with ? and ??, running shell functions in IPython, magic functions\r\n- Profiles, startup files, configuration file, kernels, and extensions\r\n- How to better use IPython for debugging\r\n- How to use IPython for profiling\r\n- Alternatives to IPython REPL\n\nSlides: https://switowski.com/python/ipython/slides/2019/07/07/wait-ipython-can-do-that.html\n\nSpeaker: Sebastian Witowski\n\nI'm a software engineer with 7 years of experience in full stack development, operations and leading small projects.\r\nI had worked as a DevOps at CERN for the past 6 years, but recently I have decided to move to Python consulting and trainings.\r\n\r\nIn my spare time, I like to give talks about Python, coding and productivity. Python is my main programming language, but I don't shy away from using different languages as well.",
