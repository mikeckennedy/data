  "description": "Revisioned Databases for MultiUser Editing\n\nPresented by John Rittenhouse (CCP Games)\n\nAt CCP Games (www.ccpgames.com), we work on large MMO projects with tens\nof content editors editing the same data. To make this possible, we\ncreated a Revisioned Database framework that allows for us to create new\nmultiuser editing systems without data synchronization between users\nhaving to be a major concern. In this talk, solutions we've tried are\ndiscussed, the basic layout of our revision database shown, the Python\nlayer which handles it transparently for the programmer detailed, and\nhow the Python layer is used in practice. All of this is focused on\ndiscussing what worked well and what pitfalls we ran into during\ndevelopment.\n",
