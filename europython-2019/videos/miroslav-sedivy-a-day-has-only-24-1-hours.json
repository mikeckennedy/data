  "description": "On the last Sunday of October you may get \u201cone more hour of sleep\u201d but\nas well may spend much more time debugging code dealing with the time\nzones, daylight saving time shifts and datetime stuff in general.\n\nWe'll look at a few pitfalls you may encounter when working with\ndatetimes in Python. We'll dissect the pytz library, explain why it\ncontains over 500 individual time zones while focusing on the 63 entries\nin Europe. We'll also find the reason why pytz is not part of the\nstandard Python, why it gets updated so often and why even that won't\nsolve all your problems. Do you know what happens after 2021 when the EU\nstops DST switching?\n\nTwo centuries of short-sighted propaganda and long-term chaos in\nforty-five minutes. Maybe that will make you want to avoid time zones in\nyour code altogether!",
