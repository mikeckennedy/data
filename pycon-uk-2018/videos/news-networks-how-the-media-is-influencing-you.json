  "description": "We live in our own bubbles with our own news preferences and biases, but\nto what extent are you aware of your own?\n\nThis talk will use keyword data to visualise the biggest topics in news\nand how they are linked to one another. I will explain my journey to\ngather this data (from web scraping with Beautiful Soup to Natural\nLanguage Processing techniques) and then discuss what tools Python\nprovides for visualising this as a graph.\n\nWe'll look at different news outlets and compare their graphs, helping\nto identify how the media selectively reports news and can influence\nsociety. Comparing these networks can also help us see any differences\nbetween what we think is important and what is actually reported on.\n",
