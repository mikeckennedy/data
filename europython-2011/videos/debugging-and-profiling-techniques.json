  "description": "This talk will give on overview over some common problems related to\nprofiling and debugging CPython applications (especially desktop-based\nones).\n\nThe following subjects will be covered:\n\n-  Debugging of memory/resource leaks (circular references, **del**,\n   weakref, garbage collector, etc.). We will show in details how the\n   memory management of Python objects work and we will show a few\n   tricks to track memory leaks\n-  Python code profiling (profile/hotshots/cProfile, design of small\n   tests, etc.). We will show how to measure, profile, and analyse an\n   application to spot performance problems and solve them.\n-  Post-mortem step-by-step debugging of C/C++ extension under Windows.\n   We will show how to setup Visual Studio for debugging, how to see a\n   traceback in case of an unexpected segfault, and how to further debug\n   and solve the crash.\n\nThis talk is aimed at intermediate Python programmers, who have already\ndeveloped non-trivial Python applications but have never \"jumped\nthrough\" the interpreter abstraction layer. If you feel a little lost\nwhen you see a segfault from a Python program or you don't have a clear\nidea how memory is collected in Python, this talk is perfect for you.\n",
