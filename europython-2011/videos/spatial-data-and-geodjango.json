  "description": "GeoDjango is the \"world-class geographic web framework\" everyone has\nprobably heard of. The purpose of this talk, targeted at people familiar\nwith Django itself, is to introduce in more details the capabilities of\nthis framework.\n\nAfter learning the basics of Geographic Information Systems, we will\nsee:\n\n-  how to get started with a GeoDjango installation,\n-  how to import, store and query spatial data,\n-  how to geo-enable your forms to allow user-generated spatial data,\n-  how to serialize and display your data using the different formats\n   and mapping frameworks such as OpenLayers and Polymaps.\n\nDuring this talk we will be building a simple GeoDjango application to\nillustrate the different concepts introduced.\n",
