  "abstract": "We hear a lot of about how much GDPR directive could affect data\nprocessing activities of companies, such as automated decision making or\nstorage of personal data. It's time to demystify these fuzzy terms and\napply specific rules in our daily processes. This talk should be as\ninsightful for software developers and data scientist as for project\nmanagers or business owners.\n\n\u0141ukasz will cover several good practices in model development: storing\nand protecting users data, prioritizing interpretability and\ntransparency of the model, keeping automated decision making in control\nand avoiding hidden biases. We will also take a closer look at social\nresponsibility aspect of our technical work. Attendees can expect to\nlearn practical techniques for responsible work with sensitive data in\nvarious domains.\n",

  "description": "GDPR doesn't have to mean slowing down the progress of your AI/ML\nprojects. By following a few fundamental rules during a development\nprocess, your model could not only be compliant with this directive but\nalso gain the trust of the users. During this talk, we will discover an\neffective approach to transparency and privacy, with profit for users\nand piece of mind for developers.\n",
