  "abstract": "We will\n\n-  Understand \"the credibility revolution in economics\" and draw\n   parallels to the current and coming credibility crisis in data\n   science\n-  Look at how we can avoid it altogether, by learning from decades of\n   econometric history\n-  Review the ideal randomized control trial and talk about why they can\n   be difficult in the context of data science\n-  Look at methods from the social science toolbox for\n   quasi-experimental design such as\n-  Instrumental variables\n-  Matching\n-  Difference-in-differences\n-  Regression discontinuity design\n-  Survey experiments\n-  Finally, review a few good papers from the literature that illustrate\n   the application of these techniques\n",

  "description": "The gold standard for validating any scientific assumption is to run an\nexperiment. Data science isn\u2019t any different. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not\nalways possible to design the perfect experiment. In this talk, we\u2019ll\ntake a realistic look at measurement using tools from the social\nsciences to conduct quasi-experiments with observational data.\n",
