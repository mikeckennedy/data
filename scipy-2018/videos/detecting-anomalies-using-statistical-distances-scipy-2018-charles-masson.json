  "description": "Statistical distances are distances between distributions or data\nsamples and are used in a variety of machine learning applications. In\nthis talk, we will show how we use SciPy's statistical distance\nfunctions\u2014some of which we recently contributed\u2014to design powerful and\nproduction-ready anomaly detection algorithms. With visual\nillustrations, we will describe the inner workings and the properties of\na few common statistical distances and explain what makes them\nconvenient to use, yet powerful to solve various problems. We will also\nshow real-life applications and concrete examples of the anomalous\npatterns that such algorithms are able to detect in\nperformance-monitoring and business-metric time series.Presenter(s):\nSpeaker: Charles Masson, Datadog\n",
