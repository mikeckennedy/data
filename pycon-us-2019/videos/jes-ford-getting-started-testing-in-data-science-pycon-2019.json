  "description": "*How do you know if your data science results are correct?* Robust\nsoftware usually has tests asserting that certain conditions hold, but\nas a data scientist it\u2019s often not straightforward or obvious how to\nintegrate these best practices. Our workflow includes exploration,\nstatistical models, and one-off analysis. This talk will give concrete\nexamples of when and how testing should play a role, and provide you\nwith enough introduction to get started writing your first data science\ntests using ``pytest`` & ``hypothesis``.\n",
