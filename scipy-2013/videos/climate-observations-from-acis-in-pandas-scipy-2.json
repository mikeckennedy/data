  "summary": "Authors: Noon, William: Northeast Regional Climate Center\n\nTrack: Meteorology, Climatology, Atmospheric and Oceanic Science\n\nThe Applied Climate Information System (ACIS) has been developed by the\nRegional Climate Centers (RCCs) and has been providing relevant climate\ndata and products for over a decade. Last year (2012) we release version\n2 of our data access protocol and made the system open to general use.\nhttp://data.rcc-acis.org\n\nACIS aggregates weather observations reported at over 20,000 stations in\nNorth America over the last 100 years. These observations are collected\nfrom a number of sources and updated multiple times a day. At any point\nin time, the system will select the best available data and merge them\ninto a coherent record. The daily/hourly observations are available as\nwell as climate products summarized over various time intervals.\nhttp://www.rcc-acis.org\n\nThe ACIS Web Services use standard web requests and formats to defined\nthe requested data product and return the results. This data can be\nfurther refined by the user in their prefered analysis environment.\n\nThis talk introduces a pandas data loader for the ACIS Web Services.\n",
