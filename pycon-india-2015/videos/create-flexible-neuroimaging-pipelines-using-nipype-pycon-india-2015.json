  "description": "Speaker: Sourav Singh\n\nThe objective of the talk is to introduce people to nipype, which is a Python project providing a uniform interface to existing neuroimaging softwares.\n\nThe project enables you to design workflows which make use of algorithms from different packages, and reduces the learning necessary to use the packages.We will also be exploring on the code required to create suitable workflows and how the different software tools interact with each other. \n\nDetails: https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015/proposals/introduction-to-nipype-and-how-do-we-create-flexible-neuroimaging-pipelines-using-it/",
