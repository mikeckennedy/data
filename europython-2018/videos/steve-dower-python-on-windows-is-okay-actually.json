  "description": "Packages that won\u2019t install, encodings that don\u2019t work, installers that\nask too many questions, and having to own a PC are all great reasons to\njust ignore Windows. Or they would be, if they were true. Despite\ncommunity perception, more than half of Python usage still happens on\nWindows, including web development, system administration, and data\nscience, just like on Linux and Mac. And for the most part, Python works\nthe same regardless of what operating system you happen to be using.\nStill, many library developers will unnecessarily exclude half of their\npotential audience by not even attempting to be compatible. This session\nwill walk through the things to be aware of when creating cross-platform\nlibraries. From simple things like using pathlib rather than\nbytestrings, through to all the ways you can get builds and tests\nrunning on Windows for free, by the end of this session you will have a\nchecklist of easy tasks for your project that will really enable the\nwhole Python world to benefit from your work.\n",
