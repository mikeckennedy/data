  "description": "This tutorial is for people who are **brand new to Python**. It's for\npeople with curioisty to feed, anxiety to overcome, and worlds to\nchange. It's for people named Edna. (And others not named Edna.)\n\nDuring this tutorial you'll be encouraged to **bring your whole self to\nlearning**. We'll start with the very basics of Python, keeping your\nfingers on the keyboard to gain as much practice as possible. Between\nstrings, functions, and other fun Python-y things, we'll discuss\nlearning deeply, nourishing our brains, and boosting happiness with\nscience.\n\nNo prior experience required; come just as you are. This about being a\nwhole person. It's about learning Python, because Python is really cool.\nIt's also about staying afloat. Being productive. Focusing. It's about\nfinding joy in the error codes.\n\nCome play. It'll be awesome.\n",
