  "description": "So You Just Took \"Python 101\" -- What's Next?\n\nPresented by Greg Lindstrom\n\nIn this class we will develop, step-by-step and as a class, two simple\ngames, Hi/Low and Hangman. We will start from scratch and walk through\neach step of each game discussing decision making, loops (\"for\", \"while\"\nand \"if\"), data structures (tuple, list and dictionary) and looking at\ndifferent ways to \"get-r-done\".\n\nYou should know a little about Python but don't have to know anything\nelse about programming (you should know how to edit and run a Python\nprogram on your Operating System). Bring a computer with Python\ninstalled if you want to play along.\n",
