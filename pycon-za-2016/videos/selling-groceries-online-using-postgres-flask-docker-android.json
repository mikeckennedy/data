  "description": "Startups are exciting. But choosing the right tech-stack can be a\ndaunting task: You want to be able to move quickly right from the start,\nbut also remain flexible as the technical requirements inevitably\nchange.\n\nIn this talk I will describe my own experience of building out the tech\nstack for a mobile e-commerce startup. It will cover: \n\n* an overview of the main design challenges \n* the chosen architecture (database, server-side application layer, API and mobile client) \n* how I used Flask to build the API \n* how I used Flask-Admin to build a management console\n* deploying the backend application using docker-compose.\n",
