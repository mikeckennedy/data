  "description": "While being geeky supposed to hold more appeal than ever, it seems it doesn\u2019t affect women, or girls, the same way. And though the rise in technology and coding in our life is undeniable \u2013 women still take less than 20% of jobs in technology, less than 10% of startup entrepreneurs and not even 15% coders. Those numbers matter cause they tell a story and based on it we can discuss if that is how we want/need it to be. And if not \u2013 what can be done to change it.",
