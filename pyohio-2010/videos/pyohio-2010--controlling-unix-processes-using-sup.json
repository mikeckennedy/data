  "description": "Controlling UNIX Processes using Supervisor\n\nPresented by Calvin Hendryx-Parker\n\nSupervisor is a Python daemon that can control arbitrary processes in a\nUNIX- like environment. It features a client/server model of control\nthat can easily be extended. This talk will cover the configuration and\nsetup of Supervisor. It will also cover how to extend Supervisor and\ntake advantage of its XML-RPC interface and ability to react to events\nthat it generates.\n",
