  "description": "MicroPython (http://micropython.org/) is a FOSS implementation of Python\n3 optimised to run on microcontrollers with MHz and tens of Kbytes of\nRAM. After a introduction about MicroPython, this tutorial will be a\ninteractive hands-on using microcontroller boards running MicroPython,\none for each attendee, practicing some scientific tools to process data\nfrom sensor boards, then publish the sensor data on web server running\non the microcontroller or on IoT Cloud. The goal is to show MicroPython\nand microcontrollers are also plataforms for scientific computing\napplied to Physical Computing (sensors and actuators) and IoT (Internet\nof Things). All hardware (microcontroller boards, sensor boards, jumper\ncables) will be provided by the presenter. Please bring a micro USB\ncable and a computer. Basic familiarity with Python 3 and terminal tools\nis required.Presenter(s): Speaker: Roberto Colistete Jr, Federal\nUniversity of Espirito Santo, Brazil\n",
