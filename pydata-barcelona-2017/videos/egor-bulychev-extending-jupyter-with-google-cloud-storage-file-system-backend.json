It allows to work with notebooks and other files directly in Google Cloud Storage. It's codebase is rather small and simple thanks to Jupyter's modular architecture. We start from the very basics, revise how Google Cloud Storage works and how Jupyter deals with the virtual file system and end up with the complete production-tested backend implementation. The described ideas are rather versatile and can be re-used to create backends for similar cloud storage systems, e.g. Amazon.",
