  "description": "In this talk, I aim to do two things: demystify deep learning as essentially matrix multiplications with weights learned by gradient descent, and demystify Bayesian deep learning as placing priors on weights. I will then provide PyMC3 and Theano code to illustrate how to construct Bayesian deep nets and visualize uncertainty in their results.",
