  "description": "DjangoCon US 2017 - Saved you a click (or three): Supercharging the Django admin with actions and views by Liam Andrew\n\nThe goal of this talk is to \u201csave you a click\u201d: while this is a pejorative phrase in The Texas Tribune\u2019s newsroom, we love saving our reporters and editors clicks in the Django admin when they\u2019re filing a breaking story. We\u2019ve combined several helpful Django features, libraries, patterns and customizations \u2013 ranging from the obvious to the advanced \u2013 to supercharge our admin, allowing for live previews, shortcuts, and dynamic updates. Taken together, these tools suggest a framework for developing new admin features quickly and maintainably.\n\nThis talk would be especially valuable to Django developers who know the basics of customizing the admin, but aren\u2019t sure where to take it next, or want to add some bells and whistles. It also opens up to larger questions about customizing the admin that would benefit more advanced Django developers. I would definitely allow time for questions and discussion to hear from others who might have tricks up their sleeves.\n\nhttps://2017.djangocon.us/talks/saved-you-a-click-or-three-supercharging-the-django-admin-with-actions-and-views/",
