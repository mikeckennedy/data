  "description": "Python & Serverless: Refactor your monolith piece by piece\n\nThe introduction of the Function as a Service (Serverless) technologies\nis facilitating the adoption of a microservices based architecture. In\nthis talk we will discuss why this might be useful (scalability / cost\nopportunities / choosing the right tool for the job) and what strategies\nwe can follow to either extract independent services or add new\ncapabilities using an event driven architecture style to a django web\napplication. We will end up our discussion talking about testing and\nmonitoring of our freshly baked services.\n\nIn this talk we will see:\n\n-  Serverless/FaaS concepts brief intro\n-  Breaking up the monolith rationale\n-  Extracting some modules into independent services\n-  Adding more capabilities using events as a trigger for our FaaS\n-  Testing & Monitoring\n-  References\n\nThe intended audience should be familiar with the concepts related to\nweb applications, web apis and a smattering of serverless concepts.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1591\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 3 May** at 11:15 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
