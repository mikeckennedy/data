  "description": "Heroku distilled their principles to build modern cloud applications to maximize developer productivity and application maintainability in the in the https://12factor.net manifesto. These principles have influenced many of our design decisions at Blue Yonder.\n\nWhile our data scientists care about machine learning models and statistics, we want to free them of being concerned with technicalities like maintenance of network equipment, operating system updates or even hardware failures. In order to save our data scientists from these tasks, we have invested into a data science platform.\n\nThis talk will give an insight how we use Apache Mesos, Devpi, Graylog and Prometheus/Graphana to provide a developer-friendly environment for data scientists to build their own distributed applications in Python without having to care about servers or scaling.",
