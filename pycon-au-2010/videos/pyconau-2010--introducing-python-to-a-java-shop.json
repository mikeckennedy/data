  "description": "Introducing Python to a Java shop\n\nPresented by Juergen Brendel (MuleSoft)\n\nThere is a time and place for everything: For some applications Python\nis perfect, for others a language like Java and its entire ecosystem is\nmore ideal. In this talk we see how Python was introduced to a Java shop\nas a vehicle for rapid and dynamic prototyping of a new project. The\ntalk then explains how Jython/Java integration was used to translate\nthis project step by step from Python to Java. Going beyond the advocacy\nfocus, the talk then shows the interfaces to call Java from Python and\nvice versa and illustrates those with examples. Furthermore, unit\ntesting of Java classes via test cases written in Python is also touched\nupon.\n",
