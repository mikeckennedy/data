  "abstract": "In the late 1980s, when the Berlin Wall was still in place and Eastern\nEurope was in the last throes of communism, a few students decided to\nmake their own computers, in their dorm room. They used smuggled or\ndiscarded parts bought from electronics dealers who came to the\nPolitehnica University of Bucharest campus. After communism collapsed\nand internet arrived in Romania, the same dorm rooms hosted some of the\nworld's greatest hackers at the time. Late at night, they bribed the\ndoorkeeper with cheap vodka to let them enter the ED011 computer lab.\nQuietly, with their computer screens dimmed, they challenged themselves\nto hack NASA, the Pentagon, and the US Army. The 1980s and 1990s were\nromantic times in technology. Back then, the focus was on discovering\nand building things with minimum resources. Hackers usually wanted to\nlearn and to test themselves, not to spy, steal secrets or make money.\n",
