  "description": "We all use techniques to classify what data we share and with whom. In\nthis presentation we look at a novel of combining the aggregate public\ndata available to retrieve non public information about users. We define\nthe way to infer private data with a certain probability from public\ndata as a degree of separation on that data.\n\nWe use machine learning techniques to first do feature extraction from\nthis combined public data and utilise predictive models to infer non\npublic data. We present an analysis starting with public twitter feeds\nfrom data scientists and then define three degrees of separation for\nthat data.\n\nIn conclusion, we show a model that combines the heuristics of feature\nselection with the security model of data classification to define the\ndegrees of separation.\n",

  "summary": "A talk about techniques to classify what data we share and with whom.\nIn the corporate and government world, there is a plethora of\nsecurity models that determines who has access to what and who knows\nabout it. In this presentation, we define the novel concept of\ndegrees of separation in data classification security models and use\nmachine learning techniques to infer non public data.",
