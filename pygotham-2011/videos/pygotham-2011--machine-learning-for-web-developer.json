  "summary": "Machine learning deals with a class of algorithms which improve and\nevolve as they process more data. It has wide-ranging applications in\nrecommendations, search, spam/fraud detection, facial recognition and\nother areas. The algorithms themselves will be covered but the real\nfocus of this class is on how to use said algorithms in the web\napplications we work on every day. I&aposll try to keep the math and\nnotation relatively light. Most of the algorithms you&aposll need to get\nstarted with machine learning are implemented for you in the various\nlibraries. They comprise the \"science\" of machine learning and I hope\nyou will decide to learn it, but mastering that material is a\nsignificant commitment of your time and mental energy (and has some\nadditional prerequisites including a strong understanding of linear\nalgebra). This class will focus on the \"art\" of machine learning, how to\nthink about machine learning algorithms and integrate them into your web\napplication.\n",
