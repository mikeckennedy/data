  "description": "BPM engines typically execute BPMN diagrams produced by a process engineer using a GUI. WorkScheme instead defines and interprets a functional domain-specific language based on a subset of Scheme. It also provides BPMN output via compilation to graphviz's dot and inclusion within Sphinx documentation of the process.\n\nDefining features of BPM are supported: concurrency of independent tasks (using asyncio); and persistence of state (pickling a stackless interpreter). Business tasks are provided by imported Python modules.\n\nA novel use for async generators is found as elegantly allowing for complex interaction between process and task. An example is two-phase commit for user interaction, improving robustness versus existing solutions.",
