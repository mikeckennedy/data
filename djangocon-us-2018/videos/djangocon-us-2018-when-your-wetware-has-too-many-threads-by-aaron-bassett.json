  "description": "Somewhere between 5% and 12% of adults have ADHD. Even if you do not\nhave the disorder yourself you probably work, live or know someone who\ndoes. But the world is not designed for people with ADHD, so to be\nsuccessful I\u2019ve had to develop techniques to keep my concentration and\nprocrastination in check.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll briefly look at what ADHD is and how it impairs not\nonly concentration but also executive function. Then we\u2019ll explore how\nchanges in the workplace can benefit not just those with ADHD, but\nanyone whose work requires creativity or extended periods of focus.\nNext, we\u2019ll look at some persistent myths about productivity, and what\nyou can do personally to increase your concentration and output without\nburning out. Then I\u2019ll present some techniques you can rollout within\nyour team to remove distractions while improving the quality of\ncommunication.\n",
