  "description": "\"Programming For Pleasure\" by: Daniele Procida\nAs programmers, we\u2019re very lucky - our work is often creative and enjoyable, and the culture of programming itself is inventive and playful. It\u2019s not surprising that one of the things that programmers like to do in their spare time is more programming. Programming can be a pleasure in itself. What we don\u2019t usually recognise is that the effect of this is to make the software we create worse rather better. If we want to make better software, we need to start programming not for pleasure, but for pain.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
