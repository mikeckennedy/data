  "description": "The CPython project is now 28 years old. It has active core developers,\nbut almost all of them are volunteers. It's difficult to ask someone to\nbe committed into a project for 5 years without being paid. Helping\nnewcomers and mentoring contributors takes time and few developers are\navailable for that. We are working on improving the diversity of CPython\ncore developers and get more active core developers, but it's a slow\nprocess.\n",
