  "description": "Especially in the world of microservices - where applications are part of the same machinery, yet able to work independently - we can leverage the fact that different programming languages have different strengths to the fullest and harness them without yielding conflicts. Neither technical ones, nor interpersonal ones. This talk is not just a comparison of two languages. At its core it is an introduction to some of the concepts of Golang for the Python enthusiast who is willing to see and use the benefits of each. It is not here to change your opinion of Python; it is here to (perhaps) give you a new perspective on software development and show you how diversity is important not just amongst humans but also amongst codebases.",
