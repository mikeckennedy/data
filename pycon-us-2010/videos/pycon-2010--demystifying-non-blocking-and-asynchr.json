  "description": "Demystifying non-blocking and asynchronous I/O\n\nPresented by Peter A Portante\n\nWe will first define what blocking, non-blocking, synchronous and\nasynchronous I/O are under the POSIX interfaces. We'll cover how and\nwhen these four types of I/O should be used, and their individual\neffects on a Python based application. The notion of concurrency will be\ndiscussed by comparing a simple threaded blocking I/O application to a\nsimple single threaded non-blocking I/O application by walking the\nattendees through the python code for those applications.\n",
