  "description": "Since Picasso encountered Henri Rousseau over a century ago, modern art\nhas been acutely aware of the value of the contributions that the na\u00efve\nartist can make. Art negotiates the relationship between sophistication\nand na\u00efvety with care and intelligence.\n\nWhat does our programming culture make of the na\u00efve programmer? What can\nprogramming gain or learn from this encounter?\n\nThe na\u00efve programmer is simply an unsophisticated programmer. Nobody is\nborn sophisticated. Even the most sophisticated programmers were once\nna\u00efve programmers. What\u2019s more, the adoption of programming simply as a\ntool to solve immediate problems, by ever more people without any formal\ntraining, means that the number of na\u00efve programmers will become\ngreater, not less. Are we ready for this?\n\nThis talk will explore the relationship, illuminating it with examples\nfrom the world of painting, art and music, and will offer some lessons\nthat our own industry and culture should be ready to learn from.\n\n(This talk will already have been presented as a keynote at DjangoCon\nEurope 2018)\n",
