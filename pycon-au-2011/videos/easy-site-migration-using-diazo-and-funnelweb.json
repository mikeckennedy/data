  "summary": "Moving old sites into a new web platform is a pain. Often you need to\npull apart perfectly good HTML just to spend time painstakingly putting\nback together again and converting hundreds of pages of content is a\nchore.

Funnelweb is a\nstatic content migration tool for crawling and manipulating site\ncontent.\n",
