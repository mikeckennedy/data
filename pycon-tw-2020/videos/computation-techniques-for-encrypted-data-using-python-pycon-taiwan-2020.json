  "description": "Day 1, R3 16:15\u201316:30\n\nThe session begins with a discussion on homomorphic properties of cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, Elgamal, Paillier, Elliptic Curve, and Gentry\u2019s Cryptosystems with the demonstration. The session discusses techniques to reduce computational complexity. This session also discusses a case study on how machine learning techniques can be applied to encrypted data for secure computation and protecting the machine learning model. The talk will include the demonstration of the Python implementation of the RSA algorithm. To demonstrate the techniques to reduce complexity, we will perform multiplication over large random numbers using common * operator, multiplication using FFT, and Karatsuba algorithm. SciPy package has an in-built implementation for FFT. To demonstrate the implementation of secure machine learning model we used PyBRAIN and cryptography packages of python.\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\n\nSpeaker: Gajendra Deshpande\n\nMr. Gajendra Deshpande holds a masters degree in Computer Science and Engineering and working as Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, KLS Gogte Institute of Technology, Belagavi, Karnataka, India.
