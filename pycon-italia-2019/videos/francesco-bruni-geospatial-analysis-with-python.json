  "description": "Due to its effectiveness and simplicity, Python is spreading as a choice\nfor handling geospatial data. From running algorithms capable of\nextracting geo- referred insights or processing geo archives, Python\ncould represent a powerful tool to handle geo-related problems thanks to\nan extensive set of libraries. The training will give an overview about\nprocessing geospatial data with Python. An approximate agenda will\ninclude:\n\n-  Introduction\n\n   -  setting up the the environment\n   -  an introduction to geospatial world\n\n-  Working with geospatial data\n\n   -  playing with geo archives (vector/rasters)\n   -  extracting geo analytics\n   -  Vector tiles big vector data\n   -  Apache Spark for geospatial raster analysis\n\n-  Python for Earth observation\n\n   -  Classifying earth observation images\n   -  Extracting insights from Copernicus products\n   -  Use SNAP from Python\n\nNo tools are required for attending this training. Bring your PC with\nDocker installed. Further instructions will be provided.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1674\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 3 May** at 10:30 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__ in \\_\\_on **Saturday 4\nMay** at 18:00 `**See schedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
