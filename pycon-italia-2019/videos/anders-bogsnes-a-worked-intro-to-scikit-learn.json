  "description": "A talk introducing the audience to Scikit-learn as a library aimed at\npeople who know Python at a beginner/intermediate level but are new to\nmachine learning concepts. The goal of the talk is for the audience to\nleave with an understanding of the foundations of machine learning while\nrespecting how easy it is to make a wrong choice that invalidates your\nmodel.\n\nIt will be a short background on scikit-learn followed by a livecoding\ndemo where I demonstrate how scikit-learn works and detail common\npitfalls.\n\nI will demonstrate ways of coping with problems such as data leakage,\nthe importance of train-test splits, choosing metrics wisely, and\nexplain how cross-validation works and why we use it.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1596\n\nin \\_\\_on **Saturday 4 May** at 10:45 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
