  "description": "Calibre is a cross-platform program for managing an e-book library:\norganising the books, annotating them with metadata, converting them\nbetween different formats and moving them between devices. Its\norganisation and metadata functionality can also be used to catalogue a\ncollection of paper books.\n\nBy default, Calibre fetches its metadata from a few large, popular\nonline sources which focus on recently published English-language books,\nand often have little to no information about older editions or books in\nother languages. However, there are many user-created custom metadata\nplugins which make it possible to integrate Calibre with more\nspecialised book databases. Calibre is written in Python, and so are the\nplugins!\n\nIn this talk I will give an overview of how to find resources to help\nyou start writing your own plugin, and describe how I forked and\nre-wrote a plugin for downloading metadata from the Internet Speculative\nFiction Database.\n",
