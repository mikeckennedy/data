  "description": "This talk was presented at PyBay2019 - 4th annual Bay Area Regional Python conference. See pybay.com for more details about PyBay and click SHOW MORE for more information about this talk.\n\nDescription\nWhat good is a code style if it's not internally consistent? What good is a linter when it slows you down? What if you could out-source your worries about code formatting, adopt a consistent style, and make your team faster all at the same time?\n\nCome hear about Black: a new code style and a tool that allows you to format your Python code automatically. In the talk you'll learn not only how the style looks like but why it is the way it is. I will do my best to convince you not only that it's good but that it's good enough. You'll see how you can integrate it with your current workflow and how it speeds up your life while making your code prettier on average.\n\nLose your attachments, delegate the boring job of moving tokens around to satisfy the linter, and save time for more important matters. Guaranteed to increase the life expectancy of space bars and Enter keys on your new MacBook's keyboard.\n\nAbout the speaker\nambv on Github. Python core developer, Python 3.8 release manager, creator of Black, pianist, dad. Likes analog modular synthesizers, immersive single-player role playing games (Fallout, Elder Scrolls), and single malt Scotch whisky.\n\nSponsor Acknowledgement\nThis and other PyBay2019 videos are via the help of our media partner AlphaVoice (https://www.alphavoice.io/)!\n\n#pybay #pybay2019 #python #python3",
