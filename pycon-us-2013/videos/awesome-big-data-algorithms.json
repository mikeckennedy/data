  "summary": "Random algorithms and probabilistic data structures are algorithmically\nefficient and can provide shockingly good practical results. I will give\na practical introduction, with live demos and bad jokes, to this\nfascinating algorithmic niche. I will conclude with some discussions of\nhow our group has applied this to large sequencing data sets (although\nthis will not be the focus of the talk).\n",
