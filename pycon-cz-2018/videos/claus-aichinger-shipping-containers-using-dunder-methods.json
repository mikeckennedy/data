  "description": "In this talk, we delve into the world of container-related double underscore (dunder) methods which define an object\u2019s behavior.\n\nWe will discover some of the most important dunder methods along the lines of the following two use cases:\n\nHow to extend a tuple to represent data?\nHow to implement a dict-like container for data handling?\nIn both cases we will try to quickly come up with implementations that not only serve our purpose, but also render easy-to-use containers mimicking already existing ones.",
