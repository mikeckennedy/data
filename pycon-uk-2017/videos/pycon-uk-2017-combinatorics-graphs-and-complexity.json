  "description": "Bill Tutte broke the Lorenz cipher and, after the war, pioneered graph theory and their associated matroids. Each graph G determines a matroid convex polytope G.\n\nFor simple convex polytopes, homology provides non-negative integers g[0], g[1], g[2], etc. Each g[i] gives a bound for g[i+1], and if g[i] is zero then so is g[i+1]. These g[i] nicely measure complexity.\n\nUsually, P(G) is not simple. Defining the homology of general convex polytopes is the speaker's main research problem. It's hard.\n\nBut all is not lost. Every convex polytope X has a flag vector f(X), as we expect the complexity of a graph to be a linear function of f(P(G)). And we already have part of the g[i].\n\nThe speaker hopes this talk contributes to the dialogue between data science and pure mathematics, to the benefit of both sides.",
