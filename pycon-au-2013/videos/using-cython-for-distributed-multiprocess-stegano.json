  "summary": "Cython is brilliant, it looks like Python but compiles to native C. It\ncan be used as a simple way of writing lightning-fast C extensions for\nPython, or for a simple means of hooking into already-existing C\nlibraries. If you are writing CPU intensive applications, like, say,\nhypothetically, cracking one-way cryptographic functions, Cython is a\nperfect mixture of simple expressiveness while making sure the 'inner\nloop' of your code is running as close to the bare metal as possible.\n\nAnd that's all this talk will be about, honest.\n\nWhy are you looking at me like that?\n",
