  "description": "This talk covers five unexpected pieces of advice for writing better\ncode comments. From an editor change to some sound writing advice, it\ntakes a brief journey into a few habits of successful commenters.\nDisclaimer: opinions ahead!\n\nDocumentation often gets paid lip service, and code comments almost\nalways suffer the most. And yet they're often that last-moment savior\nduring archeological expeditions into depths no longer known, unearthing\nobscure bugs or just trying to understand the foundation upon which to\nbuild something new.\n\nAlas, we're all human, and thus oh so very fallible. And so we fall prey\nto habits which make the situation worse over time, usually little by\nlittle. We try to be heroes, but end up the very villains we bemoan.\n\n\"Okay, how can I do better?\" you ask. In this talk we'll cover five\nsimple things you can do to hack yourself into writing better comments.\n",
