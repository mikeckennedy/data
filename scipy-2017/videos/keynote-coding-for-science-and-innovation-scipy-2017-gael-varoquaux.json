  "description": "Computing has been driving forward a revolution in how science and technology can solve new problems. Python has grown to be a central player in this game, from computational physics to data science. I would  like to explore some lessons learned doing science with Python as well as doing Python libraries for science. What are the ingredients that the scientists need? What technical and project-management choices drove the success of projects I've been involved with? How do these demands and offers shape our ecosystem?",
