Namibia, UK, Japan, Brazil, Italy, Argentina, Uruguay, Germany, Canada, USA and Spain.\n\nAbstract\n==========\n\nOne of the biggest differences, in the Python community, in relation to other communities, is its effort to improve diversity. There is even a Diversity Statement at PSF: \u201cWe have created this diversity statement because we believe that a diverse Python community is stronger and more vibrant. A diverse community where people treat each other with respect has more potential contributors and more sources for ideas.\u201d In last two years I was fortunate enough to take part in ten PyCon\u2019s in eleven different countries: Namibia, UK, Japan, Brazil, Italy, Argentina, Uruguay, Germany, Canada, USA and Spain. Some were not national conferences, but were EuroPython or PyConUS. I was coach in three Django Girls at PyCon Namibia, Argentina and Brazil. I always took note of experiences on how to improve diversity, that could be useful and replicable in my local community and would like to share at PyCon Japan. There are other reports that I also would like to share, which are only beautiful personal stories of how Python reaches the most distant people and places you may never have imagined.",
