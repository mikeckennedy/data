  "description": "Image Generation using Pure Python\n\nPyRT (pronounced pirate) is a raytracer/image generator for Python 3.5 and higher. This project is mainly done with the following in mind:\r\n\r\n* ray tracing in the Jupyter notebook\r\n* Teaching computer graphics and ray tracing\r\n* Exploring ray tracing concepts for geo data using Python.\r\n* Rendering geo data, including large point clouds.\r\n* Implementing new algorithms for rendering large 3D city models.\r\n* Creating 3D-Maps from OpenStreetMap data\r\n* Server-side rendering / cloud based rendering\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will present the project and show some examples. I will show how useful it is to create quick 2D animations, such as visualization of different sorting algorithms and I how to create fractals and other graphics. A certain focus is also on geodata therefore I will show how to create a live EarthQuake map using pyRT.\r\nIn the last part I will show to use pyRT to create 3D renderings.",
