  "description": "In the history part in \"Ethics for Software Developer\", I have heard that\nthere was no code of ethics for software developers in the 21st century. Now\nthat I have time-traveled here from the 23rd century, I realized it was\ntrue. I will share the accepted wisdom from the 23rd century about how code\nof ethics and licensing looks like.\n\nContent Warning: There will be brief mentions of pornography\nand pornography-centric applications.",
