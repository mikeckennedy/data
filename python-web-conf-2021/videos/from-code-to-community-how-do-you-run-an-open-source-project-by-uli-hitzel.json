  "description": "\"From Code To Community \u2013 How Do You Run An Open Source Project?\" by: Uli Hitzel\nWe\u2019re all using Open Source projects and libraries for the things we build \u2013 but who is behind those projects? How do you publish your own stuff in the community \u2018App Store\u2019? And most importantly, how do you get people to use your stuff and help make it better?\n\nIn this talk I\u2019ll share my experience starting an Open Source project, we\u2019ll speak about the various ways people can contribute, and what else you need besides being a great developer. Ultimately, I\u2019m hoping to find people who are keen to collaborate on some of the projects I\u2019ve started!\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
