  "description": "These days, programming style guides are all the rage. However, what if\nyour style guide was so restrictive that it only gave you\nsingle-argument functions and nothing else? No modules, no classes, no\ncontrol flow, no data structures, and not even any primitives like\nintegers or regular expressions. Just functions. Could you actually\nprogram anything at all? Surprisingly, the answer is yes. In this\ntutorial, you'll learn how as you work through a ground-up derivation of\nthe lambda calculus in Python.\n\nYou will learn nothing practically useful in this tutorial. No\npackaging. No tools. No libraries. No deployment. No magic Python\nprogramming techniques. And certainly learn nothing you would ever want\nto apply to a real project. You will, on the other hand, have a lot of\nfun, be completely amazed, and learn some foundational computer science\nthat is a jumping off point for further explorations of functional\nprogramming, type theory, programming languages, and more.\n",
