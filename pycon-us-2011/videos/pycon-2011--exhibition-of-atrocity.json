  "description": "Exhibition of Atrocity\n\nPresented by Mike Pirnat\n\nBelieve it or not, but you can write pretty horrendously awful code even\nin a language as elegant as Python. Over the years, I've committed my\nshare of sins; now it's time to come clean. Step right up for a tour of\ntwisted, evil, and downright wrong code, and learn some strategies to\navoid writing criminally bad code--if you dare!\n\nAbstract\n\nWhat does it look like when good intentions go horribly wrong? This talk\nwill take a tour through pathological code from my past (as well as some\ncontributions from friends, coworkers, and the community), featuring\nsuch terrors as:\n\n-  Lies, Damn Lies, and Hungarian Notation\n-  Crimes Against PEP-8\n-  The Diaper Pattern\n-  The Beast With a Thousand Elifs\n-  The Mile-Long Club\n-  God Objects and God Methods\n-  The Malignant Menace of Mutable Keyword Arguments\n-  The Seductive Lure of Global State\n-  Slower Applications Through DTO Bondage\n-  A Twisty Maze of Single-Character Variables, All Alike\n-  Lambdas, Lambdas Everywhere\n-  The List Comprehension That Ate Cincinnati\n-  Adventures in Wheel Reinvention\n-  New and Creative Ways to Break the Build\n\n...as well as others as time permits.\n",
