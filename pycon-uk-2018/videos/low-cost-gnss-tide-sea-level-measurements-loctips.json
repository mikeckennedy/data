  "description": "Measuring Sea levels and tides using an ultra low cost Python driven logging system\n\nA recent Natural Environment Research Council funded proof of concept\naward to the UK's National Oceanography Centre successfully demonstrated\nthat Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals reflected off the\nsea surface and received by very low cost (~\u00a330) GPS receivers can be\nused to estimate the difference in height between the GPS receiver and\nthe water. This represents a method of remotely sensing tidal elevations\nand, if averaged over time, mean sea level. These could be routinely and\nremotely measured at a cost that would allow unprecedented numbers of\nsystems to be deployed around the world by research departments of all\nsizes and levels of funding. A second follow-on project is currently\nunderway to develop the concept further and produce a working prototype\nsystem using a Raspberry Pi as the data logger and potentially also to\nconduct the real-time processing required to extract the sea level\nsignals.\n\nThis talk will describe the background to this concept of using GPS\nsignals for this purpose, and the early results from our test site in\nSligo Bay in the Republic of Ireland.",
