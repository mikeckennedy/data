  "description": "Enthought has contributed several powerful open source packages to the Python community. Some of these packages are bundled together to form \u201cThe Enthought Tool Suite\u201d or ETS. While ETS is best known in scientific computing circles, these tools are general purpose and can be used for a variety of applications In this talk we provide an overview of ETS. We provide an overview of the functionality and benefits of using some of the core ETS packages namely, Traits, TraitsUI, Chaco, Mayavi and Envisage. We will provide examples of these packages and highlight the benefits of using the ETS.\nEnthought is also working on a new Pythonic, toolkit-independent, declarative DSL to build GUIs called Enaml. We will take a sneak peek at some of Enaml\u2019s features.",
