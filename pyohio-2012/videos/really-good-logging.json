  "summary": "Really good logging means when something goes wrong in the middle of the\nnight, you know about it, and you have enough information to fix it even\nif the problem never repeats. At the same time, really good logging\ndoesn't raise false alarms and doesn't require finding needles in a\nhaystack. Logging is important, but we usually do it wrong. Let's stop\ndoing that.\n",
