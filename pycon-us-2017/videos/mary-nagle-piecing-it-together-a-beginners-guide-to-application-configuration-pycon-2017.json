  "description": "Assembling all the necessary setup for an application you\u2019re building\ncan often be more frustrating than writing the app itself. Learning to\ndo this well is difficult, especially for those who are new to Python\nand might not know where to begin or what questions to ask. While there\nis no \u201cright way\u201d to set up a development environment or application,\nunderstanding the components involved and how they interact can empower\nyou to customize your setup to best suit your needs. This talk will dive\ninto what happens when setting up a database, the purpose and\nconfiguration of an isolated environment, how Python packages are\ninstalled, and finally, how each of these components interact with each\nother and the application itself; in particular, how an application's\nstructure facilitates said interactions.\n",
