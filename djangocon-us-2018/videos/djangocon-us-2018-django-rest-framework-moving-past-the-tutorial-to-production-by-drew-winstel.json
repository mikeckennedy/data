  "description": "So you\u2019ve made your first attempt at creating a DRF API, but now you\nneed to figure out how to put the hair on the proverbial pony. You want\nto make things easier on your client developers so they can get exactly\nwhat they need. I\u2019ll walk through things that made our lives better\ndeveloping a Django REST Framework API serving a React frontend.\n\nI\u2019ll include optimizations such as embedding related fields into\nserializers, using different serializers for different users and use\ncases (HTTP methods), and using DRF\u2019s ``actions`` decorator to provide\neasy access to related tasks. I\u2019ll also touch on some third-party\nlibraries that made life way easier, such as ``rest-framework-filters``,\n``django-rest-swagger``, and ``django-simple- history``.\n",
