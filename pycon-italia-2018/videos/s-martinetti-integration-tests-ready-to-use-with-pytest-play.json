  "description": "In my talk I will introduce a new pytest plugin with which it is very\neasy (even for non-technical) go to create and run new integration\ntesting at any level of IOT complex systems.\n\npytest-play is a pytest plugin that allows you to play a JSON file that\ndescribes some actions and assertions. We can use actions like: -\nSelenium, driving the browser for the UI test - MQTT messages,\nsimulating a device - API calls - queries to Cassandra or PostgresSQL\n(in the future) - custom commands, thanks to the pluggable architecture\nOther advantages: - UI tests more reliable with implicit waits before\ninteracting with the elements - BDD support to make the scenario more\nlegible - reusability of steps\n\nI will show you how easy it is to create a json and execute it on the\nfly on a Continuous Integration system. So let\u2019s start having fun in\ntesting with pytest-play.\n\nReferences:\n\nin \\_\\_on **domenica 22 aprile** at 12:00 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
