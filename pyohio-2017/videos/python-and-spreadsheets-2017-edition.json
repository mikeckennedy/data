  "description": "Spreadsheet files are often used to share interesting & important data. But spreadsheet applications aren't always the best tool for processing that data. I'll show you how to use OpenPyXL to work with that data in a way that's better than using .csv files. I'll also discuss common problems faced when working with spreadsheets via code. \"State of the art\" moves fast here, thus the title.\n",
