  "description": "You often hear of projects porting between Python and Go. The tradeoffs between the two languages are well known, and the path is well documented with success stories on either end of the journey.  But what if you want\u2014or need\u2014to use both languages in the same application?\n\nDatadog\u2019s Agent is written in Go, but has a requirement to support a large existing library of Python plugins developed in house and by our community. During the talk we will share the benefits of supporting both languages and lessons learned about how to combine them performantly. From battling cgo to dancing with the GIL as we maintained concurrency, learn from our experiences in combining multiple languages in a single application.",
