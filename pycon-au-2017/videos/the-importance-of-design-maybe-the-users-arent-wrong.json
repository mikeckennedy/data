  "description": "Educating users on how something works is hard.  What if you don't have to?\n\nUsability design isn't just about the UI. Making your software, docs, products, and systems intuitive to use reduces frustration, support requirements, makes them safer and more secure (no more weird workarounds). 'Human error' can often be avoided by designing around what users actually do, rather than educating them on how things are supposed to work.\n\nIn this talk I will be covering Don Norman's design principles, and how you can (and should!) apply them to everything, including software, documentation, error messages and even doors. Have you ever felt stupid pushing on a 'pull' door? Maybe it wasn't your fault!",
