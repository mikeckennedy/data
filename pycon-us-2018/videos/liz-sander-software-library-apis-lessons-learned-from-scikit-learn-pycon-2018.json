  "description": "When you think of an API, you\u2019re probably thinking about a web service. But it\u2019s important to think about your developer interface when designing a software library as well! I\u2019ll talk about the scikit-learn package, and how its API makes it easy to construct complex models from simple building blocks, using three basic pieces: transformers, estimators, and meta-estimators. Then I\u2019ll show how this interface enabled us to construct our own meta-estimator for model stacking. This will demonstrate how to implement new modeling techniques in a scikit-learn style, and more generally, the value of writing libraries with the developer interface in mind.",
