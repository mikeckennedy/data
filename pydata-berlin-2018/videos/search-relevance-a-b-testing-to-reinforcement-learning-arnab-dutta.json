  "abstract": "Ranking is critical in any e-commerce platform. An optimal ranking\nshould not only be user relevant but also target at maximizing the\nbusiness KPIs. In order to achieve that, often a single optimal ranking\nalgorithm might fall short in order to achieve the desired results.\nUsually optimal algorithm selection takes place with A/B testing\nframework, however using reinforcement learning techniques, can often\nachieve similar and even better results under certain circumstances. In\nthis tutorial, we go through the basics of the standard methodologies\nfor finding a better ranking strategy, and implement from scratch a\nreinforcement learning framework to find an optimal ranking method. In\nthe process we compare and contrast the techniques and outline the scope\nof these methodologies.\n",
