  "description": "It never seems to be the right time to enter the sweet world of\nmicroservices. Each time you use \"serverless\" in a conversation, it dies\nright there near the water-cooler. How do you produce a POC, tests, a\nbuild, and proper security if your teammates can\u2019t come along? In this\ntalk you will learn to: build, debug, validate, test, secure, and deploy\nwith a build pipeline using a Python framework.\n\nYou have a small piece of functionality that doesn\u2019t elegantly fit into\nvarious domains your existing application already covers. You\u2019re of\ncourse concerned about delivering that functionality to production, and\nmaking it securely available to the end user. All of this is followed\nwith an \u201cif only I could\u201d stream of thoughts, and cautious conversations\nwith your Ops team that don\u2019t go anywhere beyond hypotheticals. This is\na perfect time to look into a serverless framework like Chalice. In this\nsession, we will discover the flexibility, robustness, and ease of use\ninherent in serverless frameworks. We will dig deeper into ways to\npackage production level code, including security, deployment, and load\nconsiderations. We will also touch on alternatives and general concerns\nfor such architectural decisions.\n",
