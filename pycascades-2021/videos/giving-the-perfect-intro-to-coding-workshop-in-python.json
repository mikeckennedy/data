We've given this workshop in person and remotely, and now we want to share our lessons with you on how to run a successful workshop for people who've never touched code before. We'll also give you our slides to the workshop, so you can go forth and spread Python with ease!\n\nPyCascades talk slides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fAm7fDbtlKLxX11Zkp80d5U-L_d1-qHy/view?usp=sharing\n\nIntro to coding workshop materials: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JPQjr_kj3NWaxh1b50dBZIHLcIT0uc17?usp=sharing\n\nHow to Prevent Zoom Bombing: https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-prevent-zoom-bombing%20\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycascades-2021/talk/RW3BAP/\n\nAfter three amazing in-person conferences, this time we're moving PyCascades online.\r\n\r\nPyCascades is a regional PyCon in the Pacific Northwest, celebrating the west coast Python developer and user community.
