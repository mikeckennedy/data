  "description": "Anyone who has ever conducted an elementary programming course, or even\nanswered a question on StackOverflow, will know that reading error\nmessages is a skill that beginners have to learn. It is less widely\nappreciated that writing good error messages is also a skill that must\nbe learnt. This talk is in two parts. The first covers the commonest\nerror message gaffes: \u2022 Insufficiently explicit messages. \u2022 Issuing the\nsame message for two different conditions. \u2022 Suppressing the stack\ntrace. \u2022 Polluting the stack trace. The second part describes a way to\nensure usable, actionable error messages, even when the writer of the\nmessage is not a professional coder. This was developed for an\nenvironment where superusers code up most of the dozens of data\nvalidation rules and the accompanying messages, and the application in\nwhich Python is embedded suppresses the stack trace.\n",
