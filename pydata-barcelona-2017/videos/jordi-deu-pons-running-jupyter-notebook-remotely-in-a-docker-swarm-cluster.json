  "description": "The current version of Jupyter Notebook computes the document state at the browser side, this is a problem if you run long jobs in a remote notebook from a laptop. If you close the browser you lose all the output of the current running cell. I will explain how we solved this problem in our lab. This solution it also allows a \"walkie-talkie\" like real-time collaboration.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThe solution is based on running a docker container with a browser and a VNC server. All the remote access to the notebooks is done using Apache Guacamole a clientless remote desktop gateway. Everything is running on a dynamic docker swarm cluster of 20 nodes. As a lateral effect, this solution it also allows a real-time collaboration between users in a way that multiple users can access at the same time the same desktop (but they have to fight for the mouse and the keyboard).\n\nhttps://github.com/jordeu/pytalks/tree/master/20170520_pydata_jupyter_in_a_docker_cluster",
