  "description": "Many Django applications start as monolithic apps, the next step is\noften to break these out into individual Django apps in a larger\nproject. This is a great step, but still requires you to use code as\nyour contract you talk across. As teams scale before 5-6 people this\nintroduces complexity and often many bugs over time. The effective way\nto continue to scale teams is to define services that talk across\ndefined API\u2019s and data contracts. This allows you to iteratively version\nservices and continue to improve them while still supporting backwards\ncompatibility.\n",
