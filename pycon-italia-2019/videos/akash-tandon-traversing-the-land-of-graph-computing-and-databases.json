  "description": "Graphs have long held a special place in the computer science\u2019s history\n(and codebases). With the advent of a new wave of the information age\ncharacterized by a greater emphasis on linked data, graph computing and\ndatabases have risen to prominence. Be it enterprise knowledge graphs or\ngraph-based analytics, there are a great number of potential\napplications.\n\nTo reap the benefits of graph databases and computing, one needs to\nunderstand the basics as well as current technical landscape and\nofferings. Also, it\u2019s important to understand if a graph-based approach\nsuits your problem. This talk will touch upon these points. Be prepared\nto learn some graph fundamentals and witness a live demo using Neo4j, a\npopular graph database.\n\nSoft pre-requisites include familiarity with Python and experience\nworking with a SQL or NoSQL database. There are no hard pre-requisites.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1682\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 3 May** at 12:00 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
