This allows us to gain more in-depth understanding the mechanisms inside Python as well as introducing some obscure but useful Python features.",

  "description": "In this talk, we discuss how some features in standard Python library can be manually re-implemented using a subset of Python itself. Examples include:\n- built-in ``range`` function\n- ``namedtuple`` class constructor\n- ``property`` decorator\n- ``Enum`` class (since Python 3.4)\n- ``dataclass`` (since Python 3.7)\n- etc.\nThroughout the process of re-implementing these features, we should gain more in-depth understanding the mechanisms inside Python.\n\n\n\n--------\n\nProgrammer: Specialized in problem solving, algorithm and data structure. Interested in robotics.",
