  "abstract": "Imagine that we have a large body of text, a series of sequels that has\nbeen going on for decades. Using NLP and Deep Learning - can we train\nour computer to write a short story by itself? Can we hint the plot but\nlet the machine fabricate the rest? In this talk I'll describe the whole\njourney: A fun ride from the idea to the very end including all the\nstruggles, failures and successes.\n\nSteps, we'll cover:\n\n-  The data challenge: get the data ready\n-  Have it run on your Mac with PyTorch and an eGPU\n-  Creating a character-level language models with an Recurrent Neural\n   Network\n-  Visualising and getting an understanding what is actually trained\n-  Creating a generator\n-  Verifying the texts generated\n-  Getting published and getting picked up by HBO ;)\n",
