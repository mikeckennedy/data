  "description": "Is your system stable? Do you know what happens if any of your system\u2019s\ndependency will start failing? Do you even know what exactly each part\nof your system does or did any time in the past? Or how fast you will\nidentify root of the problem in case your system goes down at 2am?\n\nThe talk focuses on distributed systems (microservices, APIs that\ncommunicate with databases, memory, third party services, etc.),\nmonitoring, their failures and recovery in order to help you answer\nyourself questions above.\n\nFirst part aims on importance of monitoring such systems on several\nlevels - monitoring of hardware, application monitoring, monitoring from\noutside of the systems, detecting malfunctions based on anomalies within\nsystem\u2019s data flows.\n\nSecond part presents several standard techniques for preventing system\nfailure in case of outage of dependency and technique how to recover\nfrom inconsistent state after outage.\n\nContent of presentation is helpful and interesting for beginners and\nintermediates. Senior developers and developers working on reliable\ndistributed systems should bear in mind content of this presentation and\nmaster shown techniques.\n",
