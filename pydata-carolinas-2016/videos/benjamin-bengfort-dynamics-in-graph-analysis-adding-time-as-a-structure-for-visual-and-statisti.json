  "description": "Network analyses are powerful methods for both visual analytics and\nmachine learning but can suffer as their complexity increases. By\nembedding time as a structural element rather than a property, we will\nexplore how time series and interactive analysis can be improved on\nGraph structures. Primarily we will look at decomposition in NLP-\nextracted concept graphs using NetworkX and Graph Tool.\n\nModeling data as networks of relationships between entities can be a\npowerful method for both visual analytics and machine learning; people\nare very good at distinguishing patterns from interconnected\nstructures, and machine learning methods get a performance improvement\nwhen applied to graph data structures. However, as these structures\nbecome more complex or embed more information over time, both visual\nand algorithmic methods get messy; visual analyses suffer from the\n\"hairball\" effect, and graph algorithms require either more traversal\nor increased computation at each vertex. A growing area to reduce this\ncomplexity and optimize analytics is the use of interactive and\nsubgraph techniques that model how graph structures change over time.",
