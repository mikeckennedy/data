There is\neven a Diversity Statement at PSF: \"We have created this diversity\nstatement because we believe that a diverse Python community is\nstronger and more vibrant. A diverse community where people treat each\nother with respect has more potential contributors and more sources\nfor ideas.\" The authors will share experiences on diversity obtained\nfrom ten different countries: Namibia, UK, Japan, Brazil, Italy,\nArgentina, Uruguay, Germany, Canada and Spain.
