  "description": "Reinforcement learning has enjoyed its recent prominence with its combination with the class of rich function approximators known as deep neural networks. The combination, referred as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have demonstrated to perform on complex tasks from Atari games to robotics to self-driving cars.
