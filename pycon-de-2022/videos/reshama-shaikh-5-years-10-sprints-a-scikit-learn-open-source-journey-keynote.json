    "description": "Speaker:: Reshama Shaikh\n\nTrack: Plenary\nWe all use open source tools in various capacities, yet knowing how to contribute to open source is not as well known or accessible. The limited knowledge and education surrounding contributing to open source could be one explanation of the low participation rates by underrepresented persons in open source.  Open source sprints are hands-on \u201cworkshops\u201d or \u201chackathons\u201d where contributors collaborate to resolve coding and documentation issues posted on a GitHub repository. \r\n\r\nI will share how I organized my first open source sprint in 2017, which was in-person and held in New York City. Over the next 5 years, I organized in-person sprints from San Francisco, USA to Nairobi, Kenya, as well as pivoting to online sprints due to the global pandemic.  In this keynote, I will share highlights, challenges and lessons learned.
