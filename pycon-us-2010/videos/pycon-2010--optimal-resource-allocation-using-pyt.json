  "description": "Optimal Resource Allocation using Python\n\nPresented by Ryan J O'Neil\n\nA brief introduction to modeling and solving resource allocation and\nscheduling problems using Python and SCIP.\n\nAt times a programmer is faced with difficult, possibly NP-Hard,\noptimization problems such as scheduling or assignment. Sophisticated\ntechniques exist for modeling and solving these sorts of problems which\nare well implemented in optimization solvers. This talk introduces some\nof these techniques using the ZIB Optimization Suite and its new Python\ninterface.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Audio buzzing]\n",
