  "description": "Day 1, 09:40\u201310:40\n\nArtificial Intelligence has become overwhelming popular in recent years thanks to availability of big data and the advance of machine learning based models. Among them, solutions based on the Deep Neural Network (or DNN) have produced tremendous success in various applications including computer vision, natural language processing, etc. Nevertheless, one common concern for DNN-based solutions is that they are generally very complicated and can hardly be understood by human beings. This talk focuses on a specific type of deep neural networks called recurrent neural networks (RNN). It will not only demonstrate the power of an RNN model to learn from implicit information but also explain why the overwhelming performance can be achieved given its architecture.\n\nSlides not uploaded by the speaker.\n\nSpeaker: \u6797\u5b88\u5fb7 Shou-de Lin\n\n\u6797\u5b88\u5fb7\u6559\u6388\u64c1\u6709\u53f0\u7063\u5927\u5b78\u96fb\u6a5f\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b78\u58eb\u3001\u5bc6\u897f\u6839\u5927\u5b78\u96fb\u6a5f\u78a9\u58eb\u3001\u5357\u52a0\u5dde\u5927\u5b78\u8a08\u7b97\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u78a9\u58eb\u5b78\u4f4d\u548c\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u79d1\u5b78\u535a\u58eb\u5b78\u4f4d\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u70ba\u570b\u7acb\u81fa\u7063\u5927\u5b78\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b78\u7cfb\u7684\u6559\u6388\u3002\u4ed6\u5275\u7acb\u53f0\u5927\u7684\u6a5f\u5668\u767c\u660e\u8207\u793e\u7fa4\u7db2\u8def\u63a2\u52d8\u5be6\u9a57\u5ba4\u3002\u5728\u52a0\u5165\u53f0\u5927\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4ed6\u662f\u7f85\u6c99\u62c9\u6469\u65af\u570b\u5bb6\u5be6\u9a57\u5ba4\u7684\u535a\u58eb\u5f8c\u7814\u7a76\u54e1\u3002\u6797\u6559\u6388\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5305\u62ec\u6a5f\u5668\u5b78\u7fd2\u548c\u8cc7\u6599\u63a2\u52d8\u3001\u793e\u7fa4\u7db2\u7d61\u5206\u6790\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8a9e\u8a00\u8655\u7406\u7b49\u9818\u57df\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u570b\u969b\u5b78\u8853\u6210\u5c31\u5305\u62ec 2003 \u5e74 IEEE \u7db2\u8def\u667a\u80fd\u6703\u8b70\u6700\u4f73\u8ad6\u6587\u734e\u30012007 \u5e74 Google \u7814\u7a76\u734e\u3001\u4e09\u5ea6\u7372\u5f97\u5fae\u8edf\u7814\u7a76\u734e\u3001IBM \u7814\u7a76\u734e\u52a9\uff0c2010 \u5e74\u53ca 2014 TAAI \u512a\u79c0\u8ad6\u6587\u734e\u30012011 \u5e74 ASONAM \u6700\u4f73\u8ad6\u6587\u734e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9023\u7e8c 5 \u5e74\u7372\u5f97\u7f8e\u570b\u7a7a\u8ecd AFOSR / AOARD \u7814\u7a76\u734e\u3002\u4ed6\u4ea6\u662f ACM KDD Cup \u7684 All Time Leader\uff0c\u9818\u5c0e\u6216\u5171\u540c\u9818\u5c0e\u53f0\u5927\u5718\u968a\u8d0f\u5f97 5 \u6b21\u51a0\u8ecd\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e36\u9818\u7814\u7a76\u5718\u968a\u8d0f\u5f97 2016 \u5e74 WSDM Cup\u3002\u4ed6\u4e5f\u66fe\u7372\u5f97\u79d1\u6280\u90e8\u5433\u5927\u7337\u5148\u751f\u7d00\u5ff5\u734e\uff0c\u5091\u51fa\u4eba\u624d\u57fa\u91d1\u6703\u5e74\u8f15\u5b78\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u734e\uff0c\u66fe\u64d4\u4efb SIGKDD \u7684 senior program chair \u53ca ACL \u7684 area chair\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u662f\u570b\u969b\u793e\u7fa4\u7db2\u7d61\u63a2\u52d8\u671f\u520a\u3001\u8cc7\u8a0a\u79d1\u5b78\u8207\u5de5\u7a0b\u671f\u520a\u548c\u4e2d\u6587\u8a08\u7b97\u8a9e\u8a00\u5b78\u671f\u520a\u7684\u526f\u4e3b\u7de8\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u79d1\u5b78\u4eba\u7684\u300c\u7db2\u8def\u4e0d\u6253\u70ca\u300d\u55ae\u5143\u4f5c\u5bb6\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\n\nShou-de Lin is currently a full professor in the CSIE department of National Taiwan University.
