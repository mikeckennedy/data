  "abstract": "R versus Python for Data Science: the heated battle still rages. But is\nit really necessary to be partisan on this issue? I don't think so.\nThere are strong arguments in favour of both languages and each clearly\nhas a role to play.\n\nMy contention is that the best outcome is a compromise: interfacing the\ntwo languages allows one to leverage the strengths of both sides. There\nare already a few options for such an interface. However, the recently\nreleased ``reticulate`` package from RStudio kicks this capability up a\nnumber of notches. It embeds a Python session in the R environment,\nexposing a seamless and performant interface.\n\nIn this talk I will lay out various reasons to embrace the idea of\ninterfacing R and Python, then show how the ``reticulate`` package makes\nthis possible. If you use both R and Python then this can significantly\nsimplify and accelerate your workflow.\n",
