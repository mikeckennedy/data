  "description": "Building a Python Culture at Vrbo\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise why many of us are so enamored with Python. Its simplicity, accessibility, and community make it a prime choice for many projects. However, not all software engineering shops use Python, maybe even some of the jobs you work at. Introducing Python to your company and building a Pythonic culture from the ground up is no small task, but it can be done. Join me as I take you through the journey of getting Python from zero to hero within my previous company. I\u2019ll share the experience from start to finish, including what worked, what didn\u2019t, what I would have done differently, and how I evangelized Python to bring it to be a supported language within my company\u2019s ecosystem. Viewers will leave having learned from my experiences\u2014both successes and mistakes\u2014and with a solid plan for implementing Python at their job.",
