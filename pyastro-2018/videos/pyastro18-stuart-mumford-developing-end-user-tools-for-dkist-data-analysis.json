  "description": "The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) is a 4m solar telescope currently under construction on Haleakal\u0101 in Hawaii. In this talk I will give an overview of the software under development to enable users to perform scientific analysis on the data collected by the DKIST. This software is being developed in Python using SunPy and Astropy to provide the core tools. The DKIST data centre is expected to generate approximately 3 Pb of calibrated science quality data a year once telescope operations are at full capacity. The data centre will provide no pre-processing of the data before download, which is an extra challenge to the user software. The tools that will be written for these data will include, search and retrieval from the data centre, cataloguing and searching data local to the user and then reading of this data and metadata in a way which is compatible with existing tooling. This talk will describe these stages and the new and existing tools used in implementing them, as well as the challenges faced while doing so.\n",
