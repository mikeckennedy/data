  "description": "As world rolling around Artificial Intelligence (AI), demand for the\nAI-based product seen exponential growth, so the AI research. Deep\nlearning algorithms and techniques are widely used for research and\ndevelopment of these products. Good news is that year by year Deep\nLearning has seen its glory in the release of many open source\nframeworks which ease the pain to develop and implement these\nalgorithms.\n\nAs there are many deep learning frameworks out there and it can lead to\nconfusion as to which one is better for your task. And choosing a deep\nlearning framework for an AI project is as important as choosing a\nprogramming language to code product, Data science project coupled with\nthe right deep learning framework has truly amplified the overall\nproductivity.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the common points which help developers to\nunderstand which framework will be the perfect fit for solving given\nbusiness challenges. Also, we will look into some of the most widely\nused frameworks and comparing with standard benchmarks.\n\n| Following deep learning/machine learning frameworks will be discussed:\n| 1. **Tensorflow**\n| 2. **PyTorch**\n| 3. **Chainer** and/or **MXNET**\n\nKey Highlight of this talk:\n\n-  define key points to judge any deep learning framework.\n\n-  hardware dependencies.\n\n-  anatomy of widely used open source frameworks.\n\n-  comparison of above-mentioned frameworks as per defined key points.\n\n**Who is the audience?**\n\nAnyone who inspired to code deep learning algorithms.\n\n**Audience Level** : Beginner to Intermediate\n",
