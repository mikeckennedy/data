  "description": "An overview of parallel computing techniques available from Python and\nhands-on experience with a variety of frameworks.\n\nThis course has two primary goals: 1. Teach students how to reason about\nparallel computing 2. Provide hands-on experience with a variety of\ndifferent parallel computing frameworks\n\nStudents will walk away with both a high-level understanding of parallel\nproblems and how to select and use an appropriate parallel computing\nframework for their problem. They will get hands-on experience using\ntools both on their personal laptop, and on a cluster environment that\nwill be provided for them at the tutorial.\n\nFor the first half we cover programming patterns for parallelism found\nacross many tools, notably map, futures, and big-data collections. We\ninvestigate these common APIs by diving into a sequence of examples that\nrequire increasingly complex tools. We learn the benefits and costs of\neach API and the sorts of problems where each is appropriate.\n\nFor the second half, we focus on the performance aspects of frameworks\nand give intuition on how to pick the right tool for the job. This\nincludes common challenges in parallel analysis, such as communication\ncosts, debugging parallel code, as well as deployment and setup\nstrategies.\n",
