  "description": "In 1946, Grace Hopper found a bug trapped in a relay and coined the term bug. Except the term \u201cbug\u201d for an error was actually used before, for example in 1878 Thomas Edison in his letter to Theodore Puskas. Moreover, it wasn\u2019t a true bug, it was a moth. And it wasn\u2019t even Hopper who found the moth. Plenty of bugs in the bug\u2019s story.\n\nSoftware testing is full of myths, mythical silver bullets and \u201cgood\u201d and bad practices. In this talk, I\u2019ll debunk myths, share bad practices and explain how good practices can turn out to be not so good when applied in the real world of software engineering. All with focus on our beloved Python.\n\nExamples are unit tests tightly coupled to implementation details, always unstable integration tests and targeting 100 % code coverage.",
