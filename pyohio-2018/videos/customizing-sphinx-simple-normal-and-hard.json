  "abstract": "Many Python projects use Sphinx for documentation, so much so that\nSphinx is like Python\u2019s secret weapon. It\u2019s a powerful, mature system\nfor generating static content -- not just docs, but blogs and regular\nwebsites.\n\nSphinx can also be customized and extended in various ways, and here the\ntrip gets wild and wooly. With such a venerable software stack, Sphinx\ncan be inscrutable when you paint outside the lines.\n\nThis talk gives Sphinx civilians confidence to go beyond simply using\nSphinx, towards adapting Sphinx to their needs: configuration values,\nlocal CSS and templates, installing extensions and themes, writing a\nsmall extension with a directive, and testing that extension. We\u2019ll\nconclude with a roundup of challenges and benefits that come with diving\ninto Sphinx.\n\nAs the talk provides shallow treatment of a wide topic list, follow-up\nand hands-on instruction will be given at an open space.\n",
