Nginx and uWSGI make it easy for your web app to scale and\nperform well. In this talk I'll describe how to create and configure an\nAPI focused web application.\n\nI'll demonstrate some features of uWSGI which allow your web app to\nshare data amongst separate processes and delegate work to non-client\nfacing processes.\n\nI'll show how all this can fit together with a full stack of:\nbottle+uWSGI+Nginx+Bootstrap+AngularJS\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/reed-wade-bottle-plus-uwsgi-simple-web-app-configuration-and-fun-hidden-features\n",
