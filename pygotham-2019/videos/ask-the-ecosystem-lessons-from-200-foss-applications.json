  "description": "If you had to build a software application right now, how would you do it?\n\nFirst step, Python. But then what?\n\nThis talk looks at over 200 of the most-successful open-source Python\napplications to distill real-world advice on building effective software to\nreach the masses. Architecture, testing, licensing, packaging and\ndistribution, these projects hold lifetimes of work and wisdom, waiting to\nbe learned!\n\nIn this presentation, we'll explore many questions, just a few of which\ninclude:\n\n* What userbases do Python-based applications reach?\n* Where in software is Python leading, and what domains represent its\n  biggest gaps?\n* What library dependencies appear in the application zeitgeist?\n* What copyright licenses are used by applications, and how do these\n  practices differ from libraries?\n* How many projects rely only on donations, as opposed to having foundation\n  or corporation support?\n* What can Python developers do to support and get involved in Python's rich\n  application space?\n\n\nA production application is worth a hundred blog posts and a thousand Stack\nOverflow answers. You've already heard all the talk about best practices,\nnow come hear about the practical practices from real Python applications.",
