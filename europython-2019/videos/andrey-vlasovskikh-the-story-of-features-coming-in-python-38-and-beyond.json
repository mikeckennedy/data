  "description": "What's coming in Python 3.8? You can learn it by yourself by reading an\nexcellent document [What's New in Python 3.8][1]. I'm not going to\nretell this document. Instead I'll focus on things barely described\nthere or not mentioned at all:\n\n-  Why will the new features appear in Python 3.8 and what's the story\n   behind them?\n-  What is being discussed and developed now, but won't appear in Python\n   3.8?\n\nI'll share the news I learned at PyCon 2019 from the talks and\ndiscussions with Python core developers. I'll mention the following\ntopics:\n\n-  New syntax: ``x := expr``, ``f(..., /, ...)``, ``f'{expr=}'``\n-  New types: ``Literal``, ``Final``, ``TypedDict``\n-  Future features of typing and async/await\n-  New approaches to optimizing Python: sub-interpreters, mypyc",
