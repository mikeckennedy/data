  "abstract": "This talk gives an introduction to several aspects of designing and\nimplementing distributed software with a focus on control systems and\nPython development. Topics include code layout, server architecture,\nserialization, APIs, networking, and control system design. Relevant\ntradeoffs, external libraries, and implementation details for one\nvariant are covered for each topic with Python specific example code. A\nfew minutes are set aside at the end of the talk to ask specific\nquestions and discuss Python specific implementation details.\n\n-  About the author (2m)\n-  About the example project (3m)\n-  Code Layout (5m)\n-  (Extended) Server Architecture (5m)\n-  Serialization (7m)\n\n   -  Versioning\n   -  Binary Data\n   -  Bandwidth\n   -  Speed\n\n-  Component APIs (5m)\n-  Network IO (3m)\n-  Network Discovery (5m)\n-  (Extended) Control System Design (5m)\n-  Questions and Links (5-10m)\n",
