In line with this, data scientists and data engineers have both become key members of many technology teams, a coexistence which has often motivated the debate: streaming or batch? In this talk, we discuss the pros & cons of batch vs. streaming processing, especially with respect to finding common ground between the data engineer and data scientist\u2019s workflows. We address the types of cases that are applicable to batch processing, streaming processing, or both. Finally, we present a demo using PySpark Logistic Regression for offline or online decisioning and model updating, to illustrate different ways to utilize batch and/or streaming processing to apply machine learning to real-time data.",
