  "description": "**Note, this presentation was re-recorded in a different room on sunday after technical difficulties with the projector curtailed the initial attempt, but is in included in it's original slot here.**\n\nThis session will be about including secondary students with special educational needs and disabilities in Python instruction in classrooms, after-school clubs, and summer camps. The session will help teachers (including those new to Python) and programmers who teach to design and deliver instruction to students with a range of abilities and needs. The session is informed by my experiences as a special educator, computer science teacher, educational researcher, and teaching coach in the US, and it will include examples from classrooms in which I have worked.",
