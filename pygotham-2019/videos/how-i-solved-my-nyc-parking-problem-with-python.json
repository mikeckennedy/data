  "description": "Since I have a car in New York City, my car is subject to the city\u2019s\nalternate side of the street parking regulations. This means most nights I\nneed to move my car before the early morning street cleaning that happens in\nmy neighborhood. I had developed a nightly routine around moving my car\nbefore I go to bed. I am sometimes a bit too good at this and I often move\nmy car on days I don\u2019t need to. Since alternate side of the street parking\nis often canceled on days where there are holidays, or bad weather, there is\na Twitter handle @NYCASP, which posts daily and whenever there is an\nemergency situation. I used Python, Twilio and the Twitter API to solve this\nproblem for myself so I get a text message whenever I don't need to move my car.",
