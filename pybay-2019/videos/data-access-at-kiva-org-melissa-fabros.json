See pybay.com for more details about PyBay and click SHOW MORE for more information about this talk.\n\nDescription\nKiva has provided an enormous amount of data transparency for over a decade. The data has powered economics studies and machine learning research. Attendees will be introduced to the one of the largest publicly available data sets for micro finance.\n\nAbstract\nKiva has supported a thoroughly documented REST api that resulted in many academic research papers that can be found at https://www.kiva.org/build/research as well as applications such as KivaLens (http://www.kivalens.org/#/search) , http://www.kivajapan.org/, https://www.wakibi.nl/.\n\nThis talk introduces the work completed around use of Kiva's open data, as well as an introduction to Kiva's GraphQL api and an announcement of the deprecation of the REST api.\n\nOriginal slides: https://t.ly/JJlA2\n\nAbout the speaker\nMelissa Fabros is a Software Engineer at Kiva. She comes to programming from the world of nonprofits and higher education. Melissa\u2019s interest in programming started in middle school where she was a founding member of the computer club.
