  "description": "Brum Radio is an independent Internet radio station based in the UK's second city, Birmingham. When I started at the station we had a WordPress website where the schedule had to be manually updated every week from memory, you had to leave the site to listen to shows on-demand and there was no indication of what show you were listening to.\n\nMy talk describes building not only a website for a radio station, but scripting a system to record each show and upload it for on-demand listening, without any manual intervention. I discuss how I built a scheduling system to deal with monthly and fortnightly shows (which is harder than it sounds), and dealing with fragile egos, while also presenting my own weekly show on the station.\n\nIt's a light talk presented by a very nervous but competent and energetic speaker, which aims to demonstrate how much you can achieve without being the most gifted programmer.",
