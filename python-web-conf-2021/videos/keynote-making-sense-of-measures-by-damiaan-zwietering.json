  "description": "\"Keynote: Making Sense of Measures\" by: Damiaan Zwietering\nStarting as a side project in Python about a year ago, I looked at COVID-19 data from various angles, testing my long experience as a data scientist. Aside from exploration, visualization and mapping we can have a look at what I found when relating mitigation measures to outbreak severity for countries worldwide. It will show you how these analyses typically become an exercise in interpretation, with all the related pitfalls and limitations. Join me for a session full of hands on examples showing you the daily practice of working with Python as your tool of choice for analysis.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
