  "description": "#1 PyData Warsaw\n\nIn the last couple of years there\u2019ve been a lot of buzz generated around performance of deep learning algorithms. DeepMind\u2019s AI plays Atari games, Google\u2019s AI recognizes cats on youtube, smartphones are great at speech recognition, and who knows what we\u2019ll read about tomorrow.\n\n\nIn the talk we\u2019re going to show you what\u2019s deep learning about using a couple of practical examples.
