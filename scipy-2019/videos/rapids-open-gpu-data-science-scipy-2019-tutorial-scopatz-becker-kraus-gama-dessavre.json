  "description": "The RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries gives you the freedom to execute end-to-end data science pipelines entirely on GPUs. RAPIDS is incubated by NVIDIA\u00ae based on years of accelerated data science experience. RAPIDS relies on NVIDIA CUDA\u00ae primitives for low-level compute optimization, GPU parallelism, and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python interfaces. This tutorial will teach you how to use the RAPIDS software stack from Python, including cuDF (a DataFrame library interoperable with Pandas), dask-cudf (for distributing DataFrame work over many GPUs), and cuML (a machine learning library that provides GPU-accelerated versions of the algorithms in scikit-learn).",
