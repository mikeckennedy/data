  "description": "How not to fall into a rabbit hole when debugging mysterious bugs in a large open source library.\n\nAlmost everyone uses some open source library, but when that library fails to do what you want - i.e. decoding only 2 pages out of a 4 page pdf file or it just straight up raises an exception.\n\nMany would dive deep into the code.
