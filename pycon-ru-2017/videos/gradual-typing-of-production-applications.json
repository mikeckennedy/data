  "description": "Thanks to Python's dynamic nature and minimal boilerplate, it's easy to start a project. But how do you keep it maintainable and easy to understand as it grows beyond a million lines of code? Come learn how annotating it with types makes your program better for human readers and more robust during execution. No prior Haskell experience required!\n\nIn an hour I'm going to demonstrate real world problems of big software projects that type annotations solve. The talk is going to explain how you can introduce typing to an already mature application, what is a sensible workflow to follow and how to solve common gotchas.  No ducks were harmed in the making of this talk.\n",
