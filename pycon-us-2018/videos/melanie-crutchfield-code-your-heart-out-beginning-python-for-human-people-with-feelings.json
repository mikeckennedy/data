  "description": "This tutorial is for people who are **brand new to Python**. It's for people with curioisty to feed, anxiety to overcome, and worlds to change. It's for people named Edna. (And others not named Edna.)\n\nDuring this tutorial you'll be encouraged to **bring your whole self to learning**. We'll start with the very basics of Python, keeping your fingers on the keyboard to gain as much practice as possible. Between strings, functions, and other fun Python-y things, we'll discuss learning deeply, **nourishing our brains**, and boosting happiness with science.\n\nNo prior experience required; come just as you are. **This is about being a whole person**. It's about learning Python, because Python is really cool. It's also about staying afloat. Being productive. Focusing. It's about finding joy in the error codes.\n\nCome play. It'll be awesome.",
