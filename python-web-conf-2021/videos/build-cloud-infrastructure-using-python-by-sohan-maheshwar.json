  "description": "\"Build Cloud Infrastructure Using Python\" by: Sohan Maheshwar\nInfrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. IaC is gaining popularity worldwide because it of its easier cloud onboarding, faster development process, customizability and shareability.\n\nThis talk will show how you can build cloud infrastructure using Python and serves as a good introduction to what IaC is.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
