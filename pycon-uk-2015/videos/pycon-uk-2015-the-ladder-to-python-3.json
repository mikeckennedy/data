Many of us\nare shackled to Python 2 for work. Some of us don't even have a\nmigration plan. Many people at this conference, if asked to run\n\"Python\", will launch Python 2.\n\nDaniel will encourage you to grasp the ladder, put your feet firmly on\nit, and take the next step in climbing to Python 3.",
