  "description": "Montreal, April 13, 2015 - In this talk, Pierre-Yves David goes over on the advantages of Python that helped the project both in its early life when so much feature needs to be implemented, but also nowaday when major companies like Facebook bet on Mercurial for scaling. We'll also point at the drawback of choosing Python and how some work-arounds had to be found. Finally, we'll look at how the choice of Python have an impact on the user too with a demonstration of the extensions system.\n\n* Pierre-Yves David: http://sflx.ca/pydavid\n* MP53: http://sflx.ca/mp53e\n\nRecorded and edited live by @ChristianAubry at Montr\u00e9al-Python 53 (Sanctified Terabit) with a little help from Savoir-faire Linux (http://sflx.ca/jobs).",
