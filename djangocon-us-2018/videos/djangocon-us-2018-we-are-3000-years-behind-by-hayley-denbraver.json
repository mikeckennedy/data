  "description": "Your apartment building where you wake up. The water you drink. The car\nyou drive. The road on which you drive.\n\nIn the first hour of your day, you rely on the work of several distinct\nbranches of engineering, whose practitioners are licensed and\naccountable to the public.\n\nIn the second hour of your day, you may sit down at your desk to write\ncode that dozens, hundreds, thousands, millions of people interact with\nin some way\u2013but what do they know about you, your intentions, and your\ntraining?\n\nA licensed Civil Engineer turned software developer will talk through\nhow her former field approached ethics\u2013something they have been\niterating on for more than 3000 years. She will discuss how lessons\nlearned from other engineering professions could apply to software, and\nwhere our industry may need a new approach to ethics.\n",
