Their solution was \u204e\u2727\u02da\u208a an app \u0f1a\u204e\u2727\u207a  that would mystically allow you once again to go to the footy, hang out in pubs, return to work, and re-open the economy.\r\n\r\nWith the Australian Government running an unprecedented campaign to get as many people as possible to download their particular app, what this app actually does is still widely misunderstood. Furthermore, the app is somehow supposed to be safe and protect your privacy, whilst still being useful enough to track you and provide that information to medical contact tracers. How can that even work?\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will:\r\n\u2039ul\u203a\r\n\u2039li\u203adiscover what contact-tracing is and why it is vital to curb the spread of the coronavirus\u2039/li\u203a\r\n\u2039li\u203aexplore how technology can be used to assist in the contact-tracing process\u2039/li\u203a\r\n\u2039li\u203aanalyze the COVIDSafe mobile apps for iOS and Android,\u2039/li\u203a\r\n\u2039li\u203adiscuss why you should, or shouldn\u2019t, install COVIDSafe, and how contact-tracing apps try to balance personal security and privacy with the health needs of the greater community\u2039/li\u203a\r\n\u2039/ul\u203a\r\n\r\nThose who attend this talk will learn about bluetooth-assisted contact tracing, exposure notification, and the shiny new new COVID-19 settings on their mobile phone\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 09:50:00 2020 at Python 2",
