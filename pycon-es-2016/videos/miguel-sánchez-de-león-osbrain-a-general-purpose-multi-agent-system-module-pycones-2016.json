  "description": "osBrain is a general-purpose multi-agent system module written in Python. Agents run independently as system processes and communicate with each other using message passing. osBrain uses \u00d8MQ for efficient and flexible message passing between agents. It also uses Pyro4 to ease the configuration and deployment of complex systems. Multi-agents systems can be applied for transportation, logistics, defense and military applications, networking, load balancing, self-healing networks...\n\nSlides available at https://peque.github.io/PyConES-Spain-2016-osbrain/\n\n\nhttp://2016.es.pycon.org/",
