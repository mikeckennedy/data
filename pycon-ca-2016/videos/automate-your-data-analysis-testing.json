  "description": "The scientific Python ecosystem has made a Python a great language for\ndata analysis, encouraging readable and expressive code, but data\nanalysts struggle with applying Python test frameworks to their data\ntransformation and analysis code. This talk will give a good starting\npoint: how to compare different versions of tabular data and turn that\ninto automated tests.\n\nStephen Childs Bio\n------------------\n\nStephen Childs has been working with Python for the past three years,\nprimarily using the language for data analysis. Originally from Thunder\nBay, Ontario, Stephen has called Toronto, Vancouver, Kitchener-Waterloo,\nOttawa home. Currently he works at the University of Calgary as an\nInstitutional Analyst. Stephen uses Python for many aspects of the job,\nbut it's main use is to apply predictive models to university data.\nStephen is the founder and one of the organizers of PyData Calgary,\nwhich promotes of the use of Python and other Open Source tools for data\nanalysis.\n",
