The  four Fibonacci boards move in a cyclic and synchronous way from an \"S\" to the whole \"O\" back to the \"S\" enhanced with the use of colour LEDs progressing from red to green back to red palette expressing my narrative.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on the MicroPython code that synchronises electro-mechanical aspects of the project and how I overcame the specific challenges of keeping a \u2018hobby\u2019 servo in sync with the LED light sequencing.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 14:05:00 2020 at Curlyboi",
