  "description": "Python is the most popular language in the Raspberry Pi community. Also\nwith the Raspberry Pi, it's easy to do physical computing directly from\nPython code - rather than usual embedded hardware engineering in C or\nAssembler.\n\nIn this talk I\u2019ll show examples of computing projects that use Python on\nthe Raspberry Pi and demonstrate the sort of code used in such projects.\n\nThis will be an informative session with learning possibilities to give\nthose new to Python on the Raspberry Pi a chance to get started.\n\nBen Nuttall is the Education Developer Advocate at the Raspberry Pi\nFoundation in Cambridge, UK.",
