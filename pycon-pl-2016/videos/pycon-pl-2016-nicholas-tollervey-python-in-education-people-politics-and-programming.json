  "description": "The UK's Python community play an active role in computing education in\nthe UK. Why? Because it is through education and learning that we engage\nwith our future colleagues, friends and supporters. It's how we develop\nand progress as a community. A community involves both formal and\ninformal organisations, expectations of behaviour and processes for\nmaking collective decisions. In other words, it's a political exercise.\nOrganising education to promote and sustain our community is also a\npolitical exercise: it reflects a certain point of view about how our\ncommunity should be. In the UK there are several Python community based\nprojects that reflect our shared outlook that our community should be a\ndiverse, collaborative and friendly place. With all this in mind, I will\ntell the story of one of these educational projects: the BBC micro:bit ~\na device for beginner programmers that runs MicroPython (a million of\nwhich have been given to the UK's 11-12 year olds).\n",
