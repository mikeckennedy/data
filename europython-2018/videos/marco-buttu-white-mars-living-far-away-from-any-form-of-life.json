  "description": "Concordia Station is a French/Italian facility located inside\nAntarctica, in a plateau called Dome-C, in the middle of nowhere. A dark\nand cold place: no Sun from May to August, temperatures around -80\nCelsius degress, no life. Here I am living and performing scientific\nresearch with other 12 collegues from Italy, France and Austria. We are\nthe most isolated people on Earth, more than the austronauts in the\nInternational Space Station. There is no way to move from Concordia\nuntil November, and no one can come. It is like to live in another\nplanet, and that is why the European Space Agency is interested in\nmaking bio-medical research on us, in order to better understand how the\nhuman body behaves in a such extraterrestrial environment. We will\nintroduce our studies, describe this place and our life here, and of\ncourse also speak about Python.\n",
