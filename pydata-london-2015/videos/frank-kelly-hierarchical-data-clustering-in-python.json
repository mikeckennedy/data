  "summary": "Clustering of data is an increasingly important task for many data\nscientists. This talk will explore the challenge of hierarchical\nclustering of text data for summarisation purposes. We'll take a look\nat some great solutions now available to Python users including the\nrelevant Scikit Learn libraries, via Elasticsearch (with the carrot2\nplugin), and check out visualisations from both approaches.",
