  "description": "We teach Python to 5th-12th grade girls, aiming to build community,\nbuild self-confidence, and help bridge the gender gap in tech. This talk\noffers solutions to common challenges in motivating students and\ncommunity organizing.\n\nWe will share methods to increase student engagement and aid the\ntransition to Python. We used \u201cUnplugged\u201d activities that complement\nprogramming fundamentals, \u201cblock-based\u201d logic in Scratch, and the\ndrag-to-text Python platform in Codesters. We will also share examples\nof leading discussions that build girls\u2019 curiosity about technology\nfields, including learning about role models of top women in the\nindustry, and learning about emerging areas in technology.\n\nAdditionally, organizing clubs for students from diverse backgrounds,\nwith varying technical educations, can involve bridging gaps and\nencouraging community involvement. We\u2019ll discuss methods of reaching\nfamilies and local communities, such as open presentations,\ncelebrations, and share some do's and don'ts from our experiences. We\u2019ll\nalso share ways to encourage participants to develop communication\nskills about their technical work and teamwork.\n\nWomen\u2019s rights and community activism are gathering national attention,\nand we believe that anyone can effectively run an ongoing coding club to\npositively impact girls' education in their communities.\n",
