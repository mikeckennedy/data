  "description": "The **pandas** library represents a very efficient and convenient tool\nfor data manipulation, but sometimes hides unexpected pitfalls which can\narise in various and sometimes unintelligible ways.\n\nBy briefly referring to some aspects of the internals, I will review\nspecific situations in which a change of approach can, for instance,\nmake a difference in terms of performance.\n\n**UPDATE (April 12, 2017) - SLIDES:** the talk had very few slides;\nstill, you can find those few, together with the notebooks I used live,\n`here <https://pietrobattiston.it/python:pycon>`__.\n",
