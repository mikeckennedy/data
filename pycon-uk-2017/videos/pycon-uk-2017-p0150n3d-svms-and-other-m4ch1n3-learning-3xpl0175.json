  "description": "(For the PyData Track) It is the year 2099. NetSky Corp has been hacked by a mysterious group known as the data-y0kai. Somehow they have managed to bypass the latest-and-greatest state of the art machine learning intrusion detection system and exploited the spam filter so that every corporate email is now filled with sparkling pwnies. In this conference-talk-meets-mystery-story, we will walk through a fictional investigation into how and why the attack on NetSky Corp succeeded. While doing this, we will learn about the various vulnerabilities in popular machine learning algorithms.",
