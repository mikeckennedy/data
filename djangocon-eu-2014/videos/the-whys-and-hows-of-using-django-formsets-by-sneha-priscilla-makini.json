  "description": "Are you having trouble choosing the right design approach for handling\nmultiple forms on the same page? Do you end up writing large quantities\nof code to deal with a dynamically changing set of forms? If so, Django\nFormsets is the perfect life saver for you!\n\nMost new Django users are intimidated at the idea of Formsets and more\noften than not, this flexible feature goes unnoticed! This talk will\ncover the following topics: - Where exactly does one use Formsets and\nhow? - Dealing with dynamically changing forms. - Views & Formsets. -\nWhat are the most common roadblocks and what to do about them?\n\nI will also cover how Formsets helped me code GNU Mailman's user\nsettings management feature to handle mailing list settings for a\nmultiple-users multiple-lists scenario.\n",
