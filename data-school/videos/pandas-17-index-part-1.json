  "description": "The DataFrame index is core to the functionality of pandas, yet it's confusing to many users. In this video, I'll explain what the index is used for and why you might want to store your data in the index. I'll also demonstrate how to set and reset the index, and show how that affects the DataFrame's shape and contents.\n\nThis is video 17 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
