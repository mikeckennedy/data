  "description": "Google, Red Hat, Intel, Huawei, Mirantis, Deis and many, many others are\ninvesting a lot of time and effort into improving Kubernetes. I bet, you\nhave encountered that name at least once in the past twelve months,\neither on Hacker News, Reddit, or somewhere else. Do you want to learn\nmore about the best container orchestration in the universe, but were\nafraid of the setup complexity? Do you want to see how easy it is to run\nany application using containers? Do you want to experience the joy of\nscaling application with a single click? This, and a lot more will be\ndiscussed in details. In this tutorial, every attendee will be provided\nwith an environment, and step by step instructions necessary to setup\nthe environment, build and deploy a microservices based sample\napplication. Alternatively, a sample application of any choosing can be\nused throughout the entire tutorial. All that will be performed on\nOpenShift, which is a Red Hat distribution of Kuberenets with some\nadd-ons that will be described in details at the beginning of the\ntutorial. To wet your appetite even more, here are some of the topics we\nare going to cover:\n\n-  automatic build and deployment\n-  git integration\n-  image registry integration\n-  scaling application\n-  containers security\n-  batch tasks\n\nand much more.\n\nAfter the session, every person will be able to play around with the\naccompanying code repository that was used in the tutorial, which\nincludes detailed instructions how to run it on your own from scratch.\n",
