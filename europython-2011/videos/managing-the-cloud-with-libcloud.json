  "description": "libcloud is an open-source client library for interacting with different\ncloud providers.\n\nThe primary goal of the library is to abstract all the provider\ndifferences away and expose common functionality in a nice, clean and\nconcise API.\n\nThis talk will address the following topics:\n\n-  Why a library like this was built in the first place\n-  Different problems we have encountered while building it (not all the\n   providers always play nice)\n-  An introduction to the library API (compute, storage and\n   load-balancer part)\n-  How to use it to build something useful and fun\n-  How to participate and contribute\n-  Roadmap and plans for the future\n\n",
