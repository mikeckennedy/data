  "description": "Any of you from the 80's will remember the BBC Micro. Well, I got one about half a year ago and have been fascinated by it ever since. The 8-bit 2MHz limitations are part of the joy of it.\n\nEver since I learnt it had an assembler I've been learning assembly and one day I just thought \"Let's write a C compiler for this\" (bad idea), but I went with it and that's what this talk is about my journey and findings along the way of writing a C compiler in python.",
