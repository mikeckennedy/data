  "description": "Maps are powerful tools that we use every day. Python is well-equipped\nto handle spatial data and with well documented robust libraries to help\nyou perform spatial analysis and create beautiful maps. In this talk,\nwe'll discover the fascinating world of spatial analysis by solving a\nfun problem: where can we go to see an upcoming solar eclipse? Along the\nway we'll learn about mapping topics like projections and coordinate\nsystems, best practices for map making, and intricacies of spatial data.\n",
