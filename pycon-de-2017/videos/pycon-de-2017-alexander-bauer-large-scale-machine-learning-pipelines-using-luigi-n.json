Such pipelines include parsing data from multiple data sources, extracting relevant predictive features, executing training, validation, prediction steps and finally optimizing actions to meet desired business outcome so that they can be shared and visualized to business users. In this talk, we demonstrate how such pipelines can be implemented end-to-end in a robust, scalable and extensible manner using Python, Luigi, PySpark and scikit-learn. We will share our lessons learned from using this framework in a real-world demand forecasting use case.\n\n\n**Recorded at** PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: https://de.pycon.org/\n\n**Video editing**: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\n\n**Tools**: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",
