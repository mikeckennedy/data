  "description": "The average tech company has a rough female representation of 25%. The question that is always asked is: Why are there not more women and minorities in the tech industry?\n\nAt Kyruus, we have been thinking about how to tackle this issue and address the lack of diversity by:\n\n* Improving our hiring pipeline\n* Addressing challenges during the interview process\n* Holding focus groups and sharing with the entire company\n* Discussing how to think about career growth\n\nThe majority of these efforts started with us, the software engineers. We continue our efforts because there is so much more that we can do to improve diversity in the tech industry. This talk will address what we have done, but also some of the challenges that we faced.\n\nCome to this talk to learn more about what your company can be doing to make your workplace more inclusive. Everyone can help!",
