For web servers, this is serve multiple web requests, for GUI\napplications it's doing a background task whilst keeping the UI\nresponsive. But how do we actually do that? This talk will go into how\nconcurrency and parallelism work from the CPU, OS, and threads up, how\nstate (data) is shared between them, and how this interacts with the\nfunctions that you, the programmer, write, and how you can write\nproperly behaving concurrent or parallel software.\n",
