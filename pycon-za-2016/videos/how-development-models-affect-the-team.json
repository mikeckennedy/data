  "description": "There has been a lot said about how to ensure correct quality control\nusing tests, continuous integration, peer review etc. In this talk I\nwould like to focus exclusively on my experience as an open source\ncontributor with various projects. I've contributed extensively to\nprojects I don't manage (like twisted, mercurial, cpython) and I've\noverseen contributions by others to projects like vmprof or PyPy. I\nwould like to share my experience on how various methods (tests, reviews\netc.) make me feel as a contributor and how easy it is to integrate\nchanges based on that. I think the human factor of contributions is\noften too omitted from the process.\n",
