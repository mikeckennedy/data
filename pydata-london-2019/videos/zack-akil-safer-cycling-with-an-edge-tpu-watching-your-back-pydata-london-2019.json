  "description": "Cycling in central London is an extreme sport! To give me the competitive edge I've built a machine vision model that runs on an Edge TPU that keeps me informed about the dangerous vehicles that are behind me in blistering real time. I'll show you the end-to-end process of developing and deploying the model to the recently released Edge TPU hardware from Google.",
