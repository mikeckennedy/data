  "description": "Ever wondered what breed that dog or cat is? Let\u2019s build a pet detector\nservice to recognize them in pictures! In this talk, we will walk\nthrough the training, optimizing, and deploying of a deep learning model\nusing Azure Notebooks. We will use transfer learning to retrain a\nMobileNet model using TensorFlow to recognize dog and cat breeds using\nthe Oxford IIIT Pet Dataset. Next, we\u2019ll optimize the model and tune our\nhyperparameters to improve the model accuracy. Finally, we will deploy\nthe model as a web service in. Come to learn how you can quickly create\naccurate image recognition models with a few simple techniques!",
