  "description": "My team at Hulu makes a tool called Glyph that is used internally to\ncreate realtime reports to monitor app health and feature usage. While\nexisting telemetry tells us the who and when of Glyph usage, it does not\ntell us why it is used. To gain insights into how Glyph is used by\nproduct and tech, I built a flask app to mine JIRA data for references\nto Glyph reports using the Python jira library.\n",
