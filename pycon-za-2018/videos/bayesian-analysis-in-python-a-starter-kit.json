  "description": "Bayesian techniques present a compelling alternative to the frequentist\nview of statistics, providing a flexible approach to extracting a swathe\nof meaningful information from your data. The learning curve is somewhat\nsteep, but the benefits of adding Bayesian techniques to your tool suite\nare enormous!\n\nWhat are the bare essentials that you need to know to start applying\nBayesian techniques? This talk will provide an entry level discussion\ncovering the following topics:\n\n-  What can Bayes do for me? (A brief introduction to Bayesian methods)\n-  Understanding Markov Chain Monte Carlo. (MCMC is what happens behind\n   the scenes)\n-  What is Stan? (Writing models in Stan)\n-  Using Stan in Python. (The PyStan package)\n\nThe talk will be peppered with useful tips for dealing with the initial\nchallenges of using Stan with Python.\n",
