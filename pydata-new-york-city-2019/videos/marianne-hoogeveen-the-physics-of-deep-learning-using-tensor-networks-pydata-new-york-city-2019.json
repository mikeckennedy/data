  "description": "Tensor networks have been used in Physics to find efficient expressions of many-body quantum systems, describing systems from materials to holographic spacetime. As it happens, one can also use tensor networks in machine learning. Exploring the equivalence between these two affords us intuition on inductive bias, which is the set of assumptions that determine our choice of machine learning model.",
