  "description": "What exactly *are* functions? Let\u2019s talk about functions, methods,\ncallables and closures - what they are, what you can give them, what\nthey can give you, what you can do with them \u2026 and what\u2019s inside.\n\nYou probably think you already know everything about functions, but you\nprobably don\u2019t!\n\n**Input & Output**: How do you get things in and out of functions? I\u2019ll\ncover parameters and the myriad of ways they can be specified, provided\nand accessed - including helpful hints to avoid common mistakes! I\u2019ll\ncover return values, briefly, along with variable scopes and exceptions.\n\n**Closures** : What are they, how do they work and how they can affect\nmemory usage.\n\n**Methods** : How does a method differ from a function, when are they\nmade, how do they work (where does ``self`` come from?) and how to\naccess the function inside every method.\n\n****magic**** :Make your own callables from any object!\n\n**Introspection** : Using modern Python techniques, what can you find\nout about a function, and what can you do with that information?\n\n**Bytecode** : What happens if you open up a function and look at its\ninsides? Can you change it and put it back together again? (Spoiler:\nYes, you can.)\n\nBy the end of this talk, I guarantee\\* you\u2019ll know more about callables\nthan when you walked in, along with techniques both practical and so\nextreme your colleagues will never let you merge them to master.\n\n(\\*This guarantee is legally non-binding and cannot be redeemed in any\nway.)\n",
