  "description": "We love Python and we (most likely) love Lego, so what's not to love about programming Lego robots with Python?\n\n`Lego Mindstorms EV3 <https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms>`__ is the\nlatest programmable robotics kit released by Lego.\nIt comes with a controller brick, sensors, motors and Technic Lego parts.\nThere are tens of detailed official `projects <https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/build-a-robot>`__\ndescribing step by step how to build bots and program them.\nThere are hundreds more `fan projects <https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/gallery>`__\navailable for inspiration.\n\nOfficially Mindstorms are programmed in `LabVIEW <http://www.ni.com/labview>`__.\nLabVIEW is graphical programming language, which makes it easy for\nnon-programmers to write instructions for their bots.\n\nWe are not \"non-programmers\", so the good news is that the controller brick\ncan boot from a micro SD card, which allows us to run `ev3dev <http://www.ev3dev.org/>`__,\na Debian Linux-based operating system. This is the key to running Python on Lego Mindstorms.\n\nIn this presentation you will learn:\n\n* what is possible to build with Lego Mindstorms\n* how to run the ev3dev on your bot and how to connect to it\n* how to control the motors and sensors with Python\n* about popular third party suppliers\n* how to extend your Python EV3 library to support new sensors\n* how to run a Jupyter Notebook and control your bot remotely (don't ask about security).\n\nCome and learn the basics, then program your bots and (optionally) take over the world.\n",
