  "description": "Asyncio is a relatively new feature in Python, with the ``async`` and\n``await`` syntaxes only recently became proper keywords in Python 3.7.\nAsyncio allows you to write asynchronous programs in Python. In this\ntutorial, we\u2019ll introduce you to an asyncio web library called\n``aiohttp``.\n\n``aiohttp`` is a library for building web client and server using Python\nand asyncio. We\u2019ll introduce you to several key features of ``aiohttp``;\nincluding routing, session handling, templating, using middlewares,\nconnecting to database, and making HTTP GET/POST requests. We\u2019ll provide\nbest practises in building your ``aiohttp`` application, as well as how\nto write tests for your application.\n\nWe\u2019ll use all new Python 3.7 features to build web services with asyncio\nand aiohttp.\n",
