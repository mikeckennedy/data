  "description": "NetworkZero is a Python package designed to make two things easy in a group situation: finding the machines in a network; and sending and receiving messages.\n\nIt consists of two parts: a UDP beacon which advertises services by name and discovers other service adverts; and a messaging API which offers simple to-and-fro communication as well as simple pub-sub (\"news\") facilities.\n\nThe talk will cover the origins of the module, its use, and the obstacles which might prevent its wider adoption.",
