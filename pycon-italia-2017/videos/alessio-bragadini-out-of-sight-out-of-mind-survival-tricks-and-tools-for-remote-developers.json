  "description": "Remote working and \u201csmart working\u201d is very much in fashion these days,\nbut what does it entail for the daily routing of a distributed\ndevelopment team? We will talk about tools, the disputed use of email,\nSkype, Slack but more specifically about time management, what you can\nexpect from yourself and from other members of the remote team. Is your\ncompany \u201cremote-friendly\u201d or rather \u201cremote-first\u201d? When it\u2019s time to\nspend a few days in physical proximity with your colleagues? We will\nshare some examples out of the experience of a distributed team actively\nworking with Python and Django on a daily basis, and show how you can\nmake it all work, if you work on it.\n",
