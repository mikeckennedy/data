  "description": "Your product doesn't stop while you take the time to do a massive rewrite in\norder to change your language or framework.  It seems everyone has an\nopinion on what the 'best' tools are, and views changing tools as a red\nflag.  Many organizations do change frameworks or languages mid-stream, to\ngreater or lesser success; in this talk, you'll get a real-life fairy tale\nof one company's move from Flask to Django, why each was the best choice at\nthe time, how they got team buy-in, what technical decisions made things\neasier or harder, and how they switched without stopping all product work.",
