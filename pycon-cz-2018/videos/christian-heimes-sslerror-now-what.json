  "description": "TLS/SSL is the most important and widely-used protocol for secure and encrypted communication, e.g. HTTPS. It offers more than just encryption. TLS also ensures data integrity and strong authentication with X.509 certificates. But it provides merely a false sense of security if you use it wrong.\n\nHave you ever encountered SSLError while connecting to a server, but you didn\u2019t understand what is going on? Are you running production code without TLS/SSL protection or with certificate validation disabled, because you couldn\u2019t figure out how to make it work correctly?\n\nI\u2019ll give you the rundown of the basic cryptographic building blocks, protocol handshake, inner structure of certificates, and PKI. You\u2019ll learn about the best practices, debugging tools and tips how to diagnose TLS/SSL and how to deal with certificates.",
