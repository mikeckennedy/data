  "description": "Python for Zombies: 5000 enrolled in the first Python Brazilian MOOC\nPython for Zombies is the first free MOOC to learn programming with Python in Brazil. Our first edition had near to 5000 \"zombies\". A spanish version is possible for next year. Additionally I have been taught programming in past five years at FATEC, a public university in Brazil, with decreasing rates of failure in the introduction to programming discipline. We have 100% class in labs, Coding Dojos to training and we use many funny examples to teach, like hacking Facebook friends photos. Besides the traditional university students we have, at FATEC, special classes for kids in a talent development program of the municipal government.",
