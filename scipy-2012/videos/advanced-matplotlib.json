  "description": "Matplotlib is one of the main plotting libraries in use within the\nscientific Python community. This tutorial covers advanced features of\nthe Matplotlib library, including many recent additions: laying out\naxes, animation support, Basemap (for plotting on maps), and other\ntweaks for creating aesthetic plots. The goal of this tutorial is to\nexpose attendees to several of the chief sub- packages within\nMatplotlib, helping to ensure that users maximize the use of the full\ncapabilities of the library. Additionally, the attendees will be run\nthrough a 'grab-bag' of tweaks for plots that help to increase the\naesthetic appeal of created figures. Attendees should be familiar with\ncreating basic plots in Matplotlib as well as basic use of NumPy for\nmanipulating data.\n\n`iPython notebooks used in the\ntutorial <http://github.com/dopplershift%20/Python-Tutorials>`__\n",
