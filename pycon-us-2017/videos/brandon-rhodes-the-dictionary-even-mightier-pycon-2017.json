  "description": "Since my \u201cMighty Dictionary\u201d talk at PyCon\u00a02010, the Python dictionary\nhas evolved dramatically. Come learn about all of the the improvements,\nup to and including the re-architecture that has just landed with\nPython\u00a03.6! The talk will discuss iterable views, the dictionary\u2019s\ndedicated comprehension syntax, random key ordering, the special\nkey-sharing dictionary designed to underlie object collections, and,\nmost famously of all, the new \u201ccompact dictionary\u201d that cuts dictionary\nstorage substantially \u2014 and carries a fascinating side-effect.\n\nEach new feature that the talk discusses will be motivated by\nconsidering the trade-offs inherent in hash table data structure design,\nand followed up with hints about how you can now use the dictionary even\nmore effectively in your own code!\n",
