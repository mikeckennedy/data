  "description": "In this talk we describe cis\\_interface, an open-source Python framework\nfor combining scientific models across programming languages and scales\nto simulate complex systems. Motivated by the goal of combining\nbiological models to recreate crops in silico, cis\\_interface\norchestrates asynchronous communication between models running in\nparallel without the need for major changes to the model code,\nsupporting scientific collaboration and leveraging the wealth of\nexisting computational models.Presenter(s): Speaker: Meagan Lang,\nUniversity of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana\n",
