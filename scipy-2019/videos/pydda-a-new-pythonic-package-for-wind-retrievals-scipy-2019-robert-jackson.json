  "description": "PyDDA is a new community framework aimed at wind retrievals that depends only upon utilities in the SciPy ecosystem such as scipy, numpy, and dask. It can support retrievals of winds using information from weather radar networks constrained by high resolution forecast models over grids that cover thousands of kilometers at kilometer-scale resolution. Unlike past wind retrieval packages, this package can be installed using anaconda for easy installation and, with a focus on ease of use can retrieve winds from gridded radar and model data with just a few lines of code.",
