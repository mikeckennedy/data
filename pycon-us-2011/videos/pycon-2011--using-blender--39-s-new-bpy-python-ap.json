  "description": "Since 2.5, the API has become more pythonic and self-descriptive.\nBlender's UI can show you the Python equivalent for nearly every user\naction and includes a full datablock exploration tool. Users will be\ntaught how to use so they can quickly adapt to their appropriate needs\nwith a little Blender experience and no previous BPY experience.\n\nThere will be a brief Blender overview, an introduction to the API and\nhow to use it, as well as / along with an overview of some of the\npresenter's own tools / use cases. Some other popular 3rd party Python\ntools will also be shown as an example.\n\nIf there is time, a brief demo of the Blender Game Engine will also be\ngiven, though that is a separate API.\n",
