  "description": "Using the pandas python library requires a shift in thinking that is not\nalways intuitive to those who use it. This talk will take a deep dive\ninto the underlying data structure of pandas to explain why it performs\nthe way it does under certain circumstances. It will explain why a\nMultiIndex DataFrame takes up less memory than it's simple counter part,\nwhy groupby should never be run on a non-MultiIndexed DataFrame, why the\nexample documentation for the pandas apply function is an example of how\nnot to use it, and how not taking the time to normalize data can affect\nperformance.\n",
