  "description": "When you talk to software professionals, you come away with the idea\nthat we have a case of feature-itis. An enormous number of people\nevaluate software in terms of the length of feature lists and\nfunctionality. People dismiss software with fewer features as\n\u201cunderpowered\u201d. And how many times have you heard software devalued\nbecause \u201cI could build that\u201d?\n\nAnd yet, intuitively we know that\u2019s not always true. urllib3 has more\nfeatures than requests, but people overwhelmingly prefer to use\nrequests. Android has more features than iOS, but Android hasn\u2019t\ndemolished iOS.\n\nThe reason for this is that simplicity is a powerful advantage. This\ntalk will explain what is meant by simplicity, how to judge software\nsimplicity, and how to approach building simple tools. It\u2019ll also talk\nabout how to structure your code to give the optimum balance of\nsimplicity and flexibility, to keep yourself and your users happy down\nthe line.",
