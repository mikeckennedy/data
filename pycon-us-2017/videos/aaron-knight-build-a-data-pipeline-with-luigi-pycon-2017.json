  "description": "`Luigi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/luigi>`__ is a Python library for\nbuilding pipelines of batch processes. It \"handles dependency\nresolution, workflow management, visualization, handling failures,\ncommand line integration, and much more\"\n\nIn this tutorial, we will use Luigi to build a data pipeline that runs a\nseries of interdependent jobs. We will also discuss some real-world use\ncases for Luigi, and show how it can make running a data pipeline much\nmore robust and reliable.\n",
