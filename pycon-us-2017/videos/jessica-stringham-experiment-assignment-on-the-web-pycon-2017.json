  "description": "A popular way of improving websites is to run experiments on it. We\nsplit users into groups, show two or more variations of the site,\nmeasure how well each one does, and then show the best version to\neveryone. In this talk, I'll walk through a toy Python program that does\nthe first step: splits users into groups. A few interesting problems\narise: grouping users, whitelists, and scaling. I'll share different\nways to address them. I'll also give examples of things that can go\nterribly wrong when designing experiment assignment code.\n",
