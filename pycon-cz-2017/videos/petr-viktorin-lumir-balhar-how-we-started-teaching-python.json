But there are also other ways to\nhelp others, and some don't involve life-or-death situations. What\nabout changing a person's life by teaching them how to program?\n\nTeaching doesn't just give you a great feeling. It can also help you\nmake new friends, improve your presentation skills, and even make you\na better programmer.\n\nJoin us for two stories of how we started teaching Python, what it\nmeans for us, what it can mean for you \u2013 and how we're making it\neasier for you to join us.",
