  "description": "Have you ever skimmed through a README, tried to follow a quickstart tutorial, attempted to decipher an error message, or typed \u2018\u2013help\u2019 in your console? Congratulations \u2013 you have encountered documentation! Long gone are the days of massive books with never-ending stories about your software. Today\u2019s users are smarter and less patient, which means that we no longer need to document all the things, as long as what we do document is clear, concise, helpful, and accessible. And that\u2019s where the real work starts.\nDocumentation requires some attitude adjustment, since prose doesn\u2019t neatly compile into binaries as code does. But Don\u2019t Panic\u2122! No matter what your role is in the community, you can apply a few key principles from the technical writing world to make your project more docs-friendly, and therefore more user- and contributor-friendly.\nThis talk covers strategies, best practices, and pro tips for rethinking how we create and curate documentation. This special edition will include Django-specific examples and use-cases as well as a special Q&A session, where we will try to address some of the community\u2019s top concerns and ideas about the Django docs.\n",
