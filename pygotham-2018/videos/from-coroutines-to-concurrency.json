  "description": "Asyncio and gevent are powerful libraries for lightweight concurrency. Most of the core functionality of both can be built with great simplicity and clarity from plain coroutines, supplemented by elementary components of the Python 3.6 standard library (e.g. socket & queue). Building concurrency primitives from these raw materials is entertaining as an intellectual exercise, but also excellent in demystifying the aync tools which are all-too-often treated as magic.",
