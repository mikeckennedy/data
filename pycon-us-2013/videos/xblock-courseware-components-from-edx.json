  "summary": "edX.org is building XBlock, an open-source component architecture for\ncourseware. It provides API's for creating course components of all\nkinds. Possible uses include: simple controls, new types of problems,\nnew quiz structures, interactive simulations, and new navigation\ntechniques. We're hoping to expand awareness of XBlock, and also to hear\nfrom potential users about their needs.\n",
