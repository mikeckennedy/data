  "description": "OpenStack is arguably the biggest Python project, it consist of a\ncollection of libraries, clients, services that all interact with each\nothers. In short, releasing such Behemoth ain't an easy task.\n\nDuring this talk, there'll be no magical powder, I have nothing to offer\nbut blood, toil, tears and sweat.\n\nYou'll discover how RDO the most popular community distro of OpenStack\nintegrates with upstream OpenStack production chain to release a rock\nsolid OpenStack distro with cross-CI, innovative distro making approach.\nWe'll also present the challenges we have faced and we're currently\nfacing (Python 3 we're coming!).\n",
