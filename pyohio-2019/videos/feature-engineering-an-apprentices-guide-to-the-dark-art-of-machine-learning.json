  "description": "Why is feature engineering considered the \"dark art\" of machine\nlearning? Transforming raw data into a form that your machine learning\nalgorithm can utilize seems mysterious and downright frightening! Bring\nyour wizard hat and join me as this machine learning apprentice shares\nher personal book of feature engineering incantations.\n\nWhat is feature engineering and why do we need it? When is it applied?\nIs it an art or a science? Find out the answers to these questions and\nmore as we explore different methods of feature engineering with\npractical examples provided. There are three main methods of feature\nengineering: adjusting raw features, combining raw features and\ndecomposing raw features into usable subsets. We will use datasets to\nillustrate binning, encoding, binaries, summing, differencing, feature\nscaling, extraction, and the manipulation of date/time features.\nFinally, we will explore the performance of a machine learning model\nbefore and after feature engineering is applied. As a postscript,\ncurrent automated feature engineering tools for Python will be\nintroduced.\n",
