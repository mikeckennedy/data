Check out the code for this talk on my\nGitHub profile to see if you'll find it interesting:\ngithub.com/halidebey/PyCon2018\n\nWe'll be working with a dataset of tweets and aiming to accurately\ncategorize each tweet as relevant or irrelevant for the police using\nMachine Learning.\n\nAs I'm going through a live demo of the data cleaning process &\nanalysis, I will (quickly) cover some machine learning concepts. To make\nthe talk a bit more interactive, I recommend that attendees come with\ntheir (charged) laptops and go through the code during the talk.\n",
