  "abstract": "In this talk we will present the often overlooked issue of privacy\npreservation while extracting or sharing insights from data sets\ncontaining sensitive information. We will review the various techniques\nused today for privacy-preserving data sharing (from k-anonymity to\ndifferential privacy in their different flavours), and discuss the\nstrengths and weaknesses of each. We will explain why it is hard to\nshare useful data in all cases while preserving the privacy and what can\nbe done to mitigate this. We will finish by pointing to a selection of\npromising approaches enabling the implementation of privacy-preserving\ndata sharing.\n",
