  "description": "Python is a \u201cbatteries included\u201d language, but how many batteries are\nyou using today? It\u2019s so easy to install and import a third-party\npackage that we end up forgetting how vast and valuable the Python\nStandard Library is. In this talk I\u2019ll be exploring the default Python\necosystem, the one that does not need a pip install to be used. From\ncollections to bisect, everyone from with any Python knowledge is\nwelcome to have some fun and learn about the tools you already have in\nyour toolbelt.\n",
