  "description": "In this video, I'm answering a few of the pandas questions I've received in the YouTube comments: When reading from a file, how do I read in only a subset of the columns or rows? How do I iterate through a Series or a DataFrame? How do I drop all non-numeric columns from a DataFrame? How do I know whether I should pass an argument as a string or a list?\n\nThis is video 10 of 30 in the series, `Easier data analysis in Python with pandas <http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/>`__. The notebook and datasets shown in the video are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/justmarkham/pandas-videos>`__.",
