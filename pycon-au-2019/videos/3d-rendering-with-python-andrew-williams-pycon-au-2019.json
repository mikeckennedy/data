  "description": "Create 3D rendered animations in a few lines of Python, for teaching concepts in Physics and Astronomy. Let your students write some simple code to, for example, model the movement of a bouncing ball due to gravity, and with only a couple of lines of extra code, actually render and animate the ball.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/3d-rendering-with-python\n\nFri Aug  2 14:50:00 2019 at C3.4 & C3.5",
