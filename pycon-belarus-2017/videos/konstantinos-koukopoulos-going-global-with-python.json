  "description": "Most people in the world don\u2019t speak English, and are more comfortable\nusing software in their native language. Yet around the world software\nis usually produced with English text by default. This weird situation\nmight seem normal if you think of Software Localization in terms of\nstring freezes, content handoffs and the emailing of spreadsheets with\ncontent strings. Can it be different? Can translation work follow the\npace of today\u2019s software delivery pipelines, and join in on the\ncontinuous delivery party? In this talk, we will discuss software\nlocalization and some ways that teams can improve their localization\nprocesses, from the personal perspective of a Python dev team based in\nGreece. What challenges did we face and what did we learn while building\nour own web-based localization automation platform using Django and\nPython?\n",
