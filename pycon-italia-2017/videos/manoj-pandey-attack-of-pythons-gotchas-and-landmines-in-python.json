It still\nhas syntax, data types, and some occasional dark corners. Python \u201cwarts\u201d\nare things for which people have criticised Python, typically aspects of\nthe language or mechanisms of its implementation, because such aspects\neither expose certain surprising inconsistencies, are regarded as\nomissions, or cause irritation for parts of the community in some sense.\n\nThis talk will be about common pitfalls (termed warts/landmines) that\npeople face using Python programming language.\n",
