  "description": "Exploring a new dataset visually can provide quick intuition into the\nrelationships within the data. There are a few well-developed\nvisualization packages in Python, but they often have very imperative\nAPIs that force the user to focus on the mechanics of the visualization\n\u2013 tick locations, axis limits, legends, etc. \u2013 rather than the salient\nrelationships within the data.\n\nThis tutorial will introduce data visualization with `Altair`_, a\npackage designed for exploratory visualization in Python that features a\ndeclarative API, allowing data scientists to focus more on the data than\nthe incidental details. Altair is based on the `Vega`_ and `Vega-Lite`_\nvisualization grammars, and thus automatically incorporates best\npractices drawn from recent research in effective data visualization.\n\nThe tutorial will provide an introduction to the Altair package and its\nAPI, but more importantly will dive into the core concepts of effective\ndata visualization that can be applied using any visualization package\nor tool.\n\n.. _Altair: http://altair-viz.github.io\n.. _Vega: https://vega.github.io/\n.. _Vega-Lite: https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/",
