  "description": "\"SQLAlchemy 2.0 - The One-Point-Four-Ening 2021\" by: Mike Bayer\nSQLAlchemy enters the \"Python 3 only\" world with an all-new rethink of it's Core and ORM APIs known as SQLAlchemy 2.0.   Right now, SQLAlchemy 2.0 is in its transitional \"caterpillar to butterfly\" state, which is the new SQLAlchemy 1.4 series, currently in beta releases.\n\nThis tutorial will be the premiere of the classic \"from the ground up\" tutorial of SQLAlchemy re-imagined for the new 2.0 way of working, featuring a much greater consistency between the \"Core\" and \"ORM\" experiences.   There will be nary an \"engine.execute()\" nor a \"session.query()\" to be found.  New ORM configurational patterns are presented a well.\n\nPresented in terms of a four-layered model, which include \"Engine and Connection Basics\", \"Table Metadata\", \"SQL Expression Language\", and \"ORM Usage\", the tutorial is broken into two sections and API use is presented in terms of a console runner application which participants can install locally and follow along.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
