  "description": "I like words. I vastly prefer writing an essay to drawing a picture, writing command line apps to writing GUI apps, and writing back-end API servers to writing front-end interactive web applications.\n\nBut what we prefer to do and what we need to get done aren't always the same thing, and even back-end developers will sometimes need to put together a basic interactive front-end, and the related test cases to make sure it keeps working as intended.\n\nFortunately for us, the `splinter` web application testing library offers the necessary tools for even the most JavaScript-averse developer to get started writing automated tests for their front-end components, and this presentation will walk through the essentials of getting set up to write behavioural tests for an interactive front-end as easily as you do for your back-end API server.",
