  "description": "So you've heard that the Python interpreter you use is called \"CPython.\"\nIt's written in C! But who cares? Why should you even bother to learn\nmore? Could this ever be helpful? Could it help you debug your code or\nanswer questions about how the language works? Thirty minutes is an\nawful lot of time to spend saying \"no, just forget about it\"...\n\nJames Powell Bio\n----------------\n\nJames is a volunteer at NumFOCUS, the 501(c)3 non-profit that supports\nand promotes open source in data science, data analytics, and scientific\ncomputing.
