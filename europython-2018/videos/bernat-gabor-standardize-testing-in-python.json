  "description": "In this talk, Bernat will introduce tox, an open source tool with the\nbold vision of standardizing testing. From a CIs point of view, testing\ncontains much more than just unit and/or integration tests; other things\nlike code style checks, packaging, testing under various versions of\nPython, and checking that documentation still generates, are just as\nimportant. Things quickly start to spiral out of control once you add\ninto the mix that there are many tools and ways to accomplish each of\nthese tasks. In this talk, we will learn how tox tries to abstract away\nall this complexity, how to easily run CI tests on your local machine,\nand how one can use this tool inside your CI frameworks to ensure high\nquality and easily maintainable packages.\n",
