  "description": "When tracking down a tricky bug, tools are everything. I'll demonstrate three useful debugging tools and we'll see how we can use them to find bugs, whether they are in networking, logic, or performance.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nStop using print statements forever! You'll learn how to use these tools: PUDB - an interactive, ncurses debugger Charles - a web debugging proxy cProfile - python's built-in profiling library RunSnakeRun and SnakeViz - Tool for visualizing profile output I'll also talk about the process of debugging and profiling, common error patterns and how to use your time most efficiently.\n\n**Bio**\n\nChris Beacham (aka Lady Red) is a python developer and Senior Software Engineer at Hipmunk. She also does performance, sewing, sculpture and painting in her free time, and is a frequent sight at the Noisebridge Hackerspace, where this talk was first delivered.",
