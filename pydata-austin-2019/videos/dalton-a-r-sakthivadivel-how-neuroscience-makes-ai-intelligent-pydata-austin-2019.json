  "description": "AI algorithms, which are capable of intelligent data processing and decision making, mirror the function of the human brain. How does neuroscience inform the design of modern AI algorithms? How does looking at the structure of the brain play a role in designing intelligent machines? In addition to examining these questions, we'll discuss how this will help innovate future AI design.",
