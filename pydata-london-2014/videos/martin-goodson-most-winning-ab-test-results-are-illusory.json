  "description": "Many people have started to suspect that their A/B testing results are\nnot what they seem. A/B test reports an uplift of 20% and yet this\nincrease never seems to translate into increased profits. So what\u2019s\ngoing on? I'll use python simulations to show that A/B testing is often\nconducted in such a way that it virtually guarantees false positive\nresults. I'll also mention some python functions that can be used to\navoid these problems.",
