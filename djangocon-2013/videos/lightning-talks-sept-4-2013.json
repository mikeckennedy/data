  "summary": "LIGHTNING TALKS: Sept. 04, 2013\n\nThe annual tradition of lightning talks has captivated the Django world.\n\nA lightning talk is a chance to say something to (a large subset of) the\nwhole conference. The thing is, lightnings should last \"a MAXIMUM of\nfive minutes.\" Allowing a minute between talks, if each talk averaged\nTHREE minutes there would be time for roughly forty-five talks. So\nplease don't feel that you HAVE to speak for five minutes. Say what you\nhave to say, and stop.\n",
