  "description": "There are several countries such as Zimbabwe, Nigeria to name a few that\nhave just started having python events in their countries and I would\nlike to share what steps we are taking to ensure that we are not just\norganizing these events but we are also taking necessary steps to ensure\nthat in the future we are actually really developing the skills of the\nnew developers in our nations.\n\nThis will serve as motivation and it will give a sense of direction for\nthese developing countries. In the end we are hoping to motivate more\ncountries to follow our steps. We need to show each other support and\nshare our actions, this will serve that purpose.\n\nThis talk does not need any expertise. It will benefit both new\norganizers as well as experienced organizers who have not taken some of\nthese steps already.\n",
