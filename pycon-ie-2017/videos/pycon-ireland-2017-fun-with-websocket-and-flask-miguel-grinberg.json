  "description": "WebSocket enables a web server to establish dedicated connections with clients, on which raw data can flow at any time and in any direction, free of the request/response cycle and the \"chattiness\" of the HTTP protocol. Paired with a high-level protocol such as Socket.IO, you get a powerful and easy to use framework for bi-directional, low latency communication, with clients available for Python, JavaScript, Java, iOS, Android, C++, .Net and more. Flask is a lightweight and very popular web framework for Python that makes writing web servers easy and fun, without sacrificing any power. What happens when you combine WebSocket, Socket.IO and Flask? In this talk I'm going to show you some of the cool applications that you can build when these technologies are put to work together, including streaming audio and video, real-time sensor data, automatic voting and more!",
