  "summary": "Automated tests are an important part of any software project, but\nthey're often hard to work with. Good test code should be written with\nits own set of priorities and is sufficiently different from non-test\ncode that many standard programming practices are unsuitable. I have\nspent many years writing (and reading) tests of varying quality and have\nlearned quite a lot from the experience. I hope to share some of that\nexperience and help to remove some of the pain usually associated with\nwriting and maintaining tests. This talk will cover some of the\npractical aspects of writing good tests for real code, including: 1.\nProperties of a good test case 2. How to manage setup and teardown 3.\nTesting interactions between components 4. Some tools and techniques to\nmake testing easier 1. Helpers 2. Verified fakes 3. Recording doubles\n",
