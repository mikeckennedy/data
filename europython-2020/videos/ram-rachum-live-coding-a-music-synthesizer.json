  "description": "This is going to be a fun live-coding session using NumPy and SoundDevice. The goal of this talk is to make the computer produce realistic-sounding instrument sounds, using nothing but math.\r\n\r\nAll the code will be written live and we'll hear the audio that it produces.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll start with creating a simple sound using a sine wave. We\u2019ll gradually make it sound more like a real instrument, learning a little\r\nbit about music theory on the way. We\u2019ll add features one-by-one until by the end of the talk, we\u2019ll hear our synthesizer play a piece\r\nof classical music.",
