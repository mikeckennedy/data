  "description": "Ever wondered if you should try type checking in your Python project, or\nwhat it takes to get started with mypy? I will show how to introduce\ntype checking the easy way, one step at a time.\n\nDropbox was an early adopter of type checking and mypy, and we\u2019ve been\ngradually adding type annotations to our large production codebases\nsince 2016. Engineers love how type annotations improve the clarity of\ncode, and how mypy can surface hard-to-find bugs. We\u2019ve learned a lot in\nthe process of annotating millions of lines of code, and in this talk\nyou\u2019ll learn battle- tested approaches for adding type checking to an\nexisting codebase.\n\nI expect no previous experience with mypy. You\u2019ll benefit the most if\nyou\u2019ve worked on a project with multiple developers.\n",
