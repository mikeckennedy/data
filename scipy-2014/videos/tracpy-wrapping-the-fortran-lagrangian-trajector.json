  "description": "Numerical Lagrangian tracking is a way to follow parcels of fluid as\nthey are advected by a numerical circulation model. This is a natural\nmethod to investigate transport in a system and understand the physics\non the wide range of length scales that are actually experienced by a\ndrifter. TRACMASS is a tool for Lagrangian trajectory modeling that has\nbeen developed over the past two decades. It has been used to better\nunderstand physics and its applications to real-world problems in many\nareas around the world, in both atmospheric and oceanic settings.\nTRACMASS is written in FORTRAN, which is great for speed but not as\ngreat for ease of use. This code has been wrapped in Python to run\nbatches of simulations and improve accessibility --- and dubbed TracPy.\n\nIn this talk, I will outline some of the interesting features of the\nTRACMASS algorithm and several applications, then discuss the layout of\nthe TracPy code. The code setup and organization have been a learning\nprocess and I will also share some of my hard-earned lessons.\n\nTracPy is continually in development and is available `on\nGitHub <https://github.com/kthyng/tracpy>`__.\n",
