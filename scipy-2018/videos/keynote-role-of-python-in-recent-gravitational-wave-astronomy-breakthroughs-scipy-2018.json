  "description": "In September 2015, exactly 100 years after Einstein first unveiled his\ntheory of General Relativity, the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detected the first gravitational\nwave signal from the collision of two black holes, a discovery honored\nby the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Now, three years later, observations\nof these binary black hole mergers are becoming routine, and the first\nneutron star merger signal recorded by LIGO and partner European\nfacility Virgo in August 2017 was accompanied by a blast of gamma-ray,\nX-ray, optical, infrared, and radio light, that is now a Rosetta stone\nfor understanding the origin of heavy elements in the cosmos. I will\ntalk about the role of Python in these discoveries: from operating the\ndetectors, to analyzing the data, pushing alerts to astronomers, and\nconnecting scientists and educators with LIGO open data.Presenter(s):\nSpeaker: Leo Singer, LIGO\n",
