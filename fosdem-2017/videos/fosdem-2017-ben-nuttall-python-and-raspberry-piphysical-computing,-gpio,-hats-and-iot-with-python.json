  "description": "Introducing Python developers to the world of physical computing and IoT using Python on the Raspberry Pi.There's great fun to be had using the Pi's GPIO pins to connect with the real world for home automation and IoT projects. Python libraries like GPIO Zero, Picamera and Sense HAT provide a simple interface to GPIO devices, HATs and more.I will demonstrate the possibilities and show the power of Python in this environment.",
