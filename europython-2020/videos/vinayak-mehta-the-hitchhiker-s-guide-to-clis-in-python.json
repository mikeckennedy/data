  "description": "Learn all about CLIs and how to create one\n\nCommand-line applications and interfaces are used by both newcomers and experienced Python developers everyday. But do you know how they came to be? Hop on to this ship as we go through the CLI galaxy and look at its history, explore the CLI anatomy and discover some Python packages that can help us create them.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll then look at some widely used CLIs of our time. And emulate one of them by creating our own CLI using Click. Finally, we\u2019ll package it and publish it on PyPI. Are you ready to travel faster-than-light using this ship\u2019s Infinite Improbability Drive? Carry your towel!",
