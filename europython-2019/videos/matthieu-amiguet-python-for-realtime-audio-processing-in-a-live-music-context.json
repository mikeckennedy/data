  "description": "At Les Chemins de Traverse we explore ways of \"augmenting\" acoustical\nmusical instruments with new sonic possibilities offered by computers.\nFor doing so, we need ultra-low latency real-time audio processing\nprograms. Pretty much the typical situation where python should *not* be\nused, right? Wrong. As it happens, that's exactly what we've been doing\nfor the past few years.\n\nBuilding on Olivier Belanger's wonderful pyo module and (ab)using\npython's flexibility, we developed custom software to allow us to\nexpress our musical ideas.\n\nIf you want to hear how it sounds, you should go to Europython's social\nevent that will feature a gig based on python-augmented (!) instruments.\nAnd if you want to know how we came to use python in this context and\nhow we do it, you should come to this talk!",
