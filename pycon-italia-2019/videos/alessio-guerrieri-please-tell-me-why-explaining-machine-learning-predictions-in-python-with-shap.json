  "description": "In this talk we will discuss the problem of making results coming from\nmachine learning models understandable to both the data scientists and\nthe final users. While most machine learning frameworks already include\nmetrics that measure the importance of different features during\ntraining, fewer allow us to understand which features were most\nimportant for a specific prediction at runtime. We will describe our use\ncase, discuss a few options and finally present Shap, an open-source\npython library able to interpret many different models. Shap comes with\nboth general purpose tools and specialized tools for families of machine\nlearning models and with integrations for Jupyter and Matplotlib for\neasy use during exploration and testing of a model.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1601\n\nin \\_\\_on **Saturday 4 May** at 17:15 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
