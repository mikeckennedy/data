But just because\nit\u2019s in the cloud, doesn\u2019t mean development and deployment is\neffortless. The cloud presents infrastructure and development challenges\nin a new way.\n\nIn this presentation, ActiveState's Gisle Aas will share best practices\nin building and deploying a Python-centric LAMP stack(s) on the cloud\nfor a range of web-based applications from simple Django site to HPC GPU\nClusters.\n\nBased on ActiveState\u2019s experiences, Gisle will discuss the challenges\nfaced and lessons learned in building an infrastructure to deploy web\napplications to the cloud with Python.\n\nYou will learn about:\n\n-  Which packages are critical for a secure, Python-centric LAMP stack\n   (and what it takes to build them)!\n-  Tips for developing, deploying, and scaling Python applicaitons in\n   the cloud\n-  How to use Python to connect and build infrastructure to support and\n   manage your deployment\n\n",
