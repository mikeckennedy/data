Or\nmaybe you\u2019re not familiar with JavaScript at all and want to learn it\nbut you don\u2019t know where to start? Then this talk is for you!\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about modern JavaScript from a perspective of a Python\ndeveloper. By the end of the talk you\u2019ll know everything you need to\nknow about the language, its ecosystem, and different tools and\nframeworks. You\u2019ll be able to start using JavaScript more confidently\nand be familiar with different tools that are at your disposal.\n\nWe\u2019ll go over all the things I wish I\u2019d known when I first got started\nwith JavaScript.:\n\n-  Basics of the language (types, operators, data structures, functions,\n   modules, etc. as seen in ES6) and how they are similar to or\n   different from Python.\n-  Overview of the commonly used development and build tools.\n-  Overview of the popular frontend frameworks.\n-  A look into the newest features of ES6 and Typescript.\n-  How to get started and make sense of everything with so much going\n   on.\n",
