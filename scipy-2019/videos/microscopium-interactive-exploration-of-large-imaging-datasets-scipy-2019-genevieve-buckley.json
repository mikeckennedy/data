  "description": "Microscopium is an open source library and web application to explore large datasets of related images interactively. It is being developed openly at https://github.com/microscopium/microscopium, and runs on a SciPy stack of NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image, scikit-learn, and Bokeh. We will show that 2D embedding of images according to similarity is sufficient to discover relationships between drugs and genes of interest.",
