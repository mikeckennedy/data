  "description": "DjangoCon US 2017 -  The Power and Responsibility of Unicode Adoption by Katie McLaughlin\n\nCommunication is difficult. Whether between humans, machines, or a combination of the two, trying to translate meaningful information is a lossy process.\n\nConverting programming languages to use the new Unicode standard is hard, but once it\u2019s in place, you get this marvelous feature-add: emoji compatibility. No longer do we have to make faces with symbols or use platform-specific emoticons. Rejoice in the extended character set.\n\nEmoji have a rich history as a way to allow the communication of ideas in a reduced amount of data. They date back to a time where this was important: SMS communications in Japan. However, as social networks feverishly try to clamber onto this bandwagon, their implementations of the standard create issues with miscommunication that aren\u2019t possible with a 12\u00d712 pictograph.\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss the history of emoji, cross-platform adoption, the Unicode standard, and emoji accessibility in web applications.\n\nhttps://2017.djangocon.us/talks/the-power-and-responsibility-of-unicode-adoption/",
