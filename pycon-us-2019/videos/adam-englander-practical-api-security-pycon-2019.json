  "description": "With the dominance of Mobile Apps, Single Page Apps for the Web, and\nMicro-Services, we are all building more APIs than ever before. Like\nmany other developers, I had struggled with finding the right mix of\nsecurity and simplicity for securing APIs. Some standards from the IETF\nhave made it possible to accomplish both. Let me show you how to utilize\nexisting libraries to lock down you API without writing a ton of code.\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to write a secure API with future\nproof security utilizing JOSE. JOSE is a collection of complimentary\nstandards: JWT, JWE, JWS, JWA, and JWK. JOSE is used by OAuth, OpenID,\nand others to secure communications between APIs and consumers. Now you\ncan use it to secure your API.\n",
