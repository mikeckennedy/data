  "description": "This training session will introduce the Python scientific stack to\nbeginner or intermediate-level Python programmers. The basics of\nscientific programming with Python will be presented:\n\n-  creation of arrays and structured arrays using numpy\n-  fast, loopless manipulation of numpy arrays through fancy indexing\n   and vectorized functions\n-  convenient saving/loading of array variables using numpy\n-  improved interactive use through ipython\n-  data analysis using various scipy modules (signal analysis, image\n   classification, etc)\n-  plotting large time series, histograms, scatterplots, images etc.\n   using matplotlib\n-  saving/loading large datasets in structured scientific formats such\n   as netCDF, HDF (depending on interest)\n\nThese concepts will be used in coding exercises, in the programming\nenvironnement provided by the Python(x,y) distribution, which is freely\ndownloadable and includes recent versions of Python, numpy and\nmatplotlib. The Python(x,y) distribution runs on Windows, which will be\nthe OS of choice for this session. You should still be able to follow\nthe examples in other Python distributions, e.g. EPD.\n\nThe entire talk (PDF), code samples and data files can be downloaded\nfrom the following\n`archive <http://www.lmd.polytechnique.fr/~noel/EP2011/DivingIntoSci%20entificPython.zip>`__\n",
