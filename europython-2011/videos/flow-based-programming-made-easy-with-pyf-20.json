  "description": "PyF is a python framework to ease flow based programming and allow\nmassive data crunching on multiple CPUs. We boast an optional web-based\ninterface to visually design processing tubes, batch scheduling, report\ngeneration and email alerts.\n\nThe Framework is easily extensible by writing plugins, a lot of features\nlike data persistence, reporting and web scrapping are already part of\nthe ecosystem.\n\nThis presentation will focus on an introduction to PyF architecture and\nhigher-level designer ui use and how it could be useful to you.\n\nIf available, an additional training session will focus on working with\nthe framework to create your own flow-based processes and plugins.\n\nFor more information: http://www.pyfproject.org/\n",
