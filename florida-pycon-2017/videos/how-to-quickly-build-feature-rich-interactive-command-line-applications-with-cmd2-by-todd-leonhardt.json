  "description": "`cmd2 <https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2>`__ is a tool for building\ninteractive command line applications in Python. Its goal is to make it\nquick and easy for developers to build feature-rich and user-friendly\ninteractive command line applications. It provides a simple API which is\nan extension of Python\u2019s built-in\n`cmd <https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html>`__ module. cmd2\nprovides a wealth of features on top of cmd to make your life easier and\neliminates much of the boilerplate code which would be necessary when\nusing cmd.\n\nMain Features\n\n-  Searchable command history (``history`` command and ``<Ctrl>+r``)\n-  Text file scripting of your application with ``load`` (``@``) and\n   ``_relative_load`` (``@@``)\n-  Python scripting of your application with ``pyscript``\n-  Run shell commands with ``!``\n-  Pipe command output to shell commands with ``|``\n-  Redirect command output to file with ``>``, ``>>``; input from file\n   with ``<``\n-  Bare ``>``, ``>>`` with no filename send output to paste buffer\n   (clipboard)\n-  ``py`` enters interactive Python console (opt-in ``ipy`` for IPython\n   console)\n-  Multi-line, case-insensitive, and abbreviated commands\n-  Special-character command shortcuts (beyond cmd\u2019s ``@`` and ``!``)\n-  Settable environment parameters\n-  Parsing commands with flags\n-  Unicode character support ( *Python 3 only* )\n-  Good tab-completion of commands, file system paths, and shell\n   commands\n-  Python 2.7 and 3.3+ support\n-  Linux, macOS and Windows support\n-  Trivial to provide built-in help for all commands\n-  Built-in regression testing framework for your applications\n   (transcript-based testing)",
