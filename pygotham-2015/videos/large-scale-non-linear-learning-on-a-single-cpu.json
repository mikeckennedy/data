  "description": "This talk presents several methods for learning non-linear models on a\nsingle machine, where the dataset does not fit into ram. It will cover\nthe hashing trick, kernel approximations, neural networks, and extreme\nlearning machines (random neural networks). This will be a fairly\ntechnical talk, showing off some of the lesser known out-of-core\ncapabilities of scikit-learn.\n",
