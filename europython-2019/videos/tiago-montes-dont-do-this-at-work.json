  "description": "In this talk I reframe a computer programming workshop for kids I\ndelivered earlier this year, exploring and sharing my experience\nthroughout that journey, from preparation to delivery, by recreating a\nsimple yet engaging enough game.\n\nWith that I'll both demonstrate several Python related techniques and\ntools many may not be aware of, on one hand, and, on the other, extract\nprovocative questions about general learning processes, especially when\ntargeted at professional developers.\n\nI promise zero slides and a somewhat fast-paced live (re)coding session,\nintertwined with comments on good/bad techniques, along with a\nsurprising exploration of the turtle module in the Standard Library --\nit is more capable than you think.\n\nI wrap up with a self-code review and with thoughts on how such a game\ncould be improved, what implications that could have for both beginners\nand seasoned professionals: should you do this at work?\n\nTargeting 10 minute Q&A / discussion by the end!",
