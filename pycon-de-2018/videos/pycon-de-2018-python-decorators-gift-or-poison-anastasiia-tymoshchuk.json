  "description": "Why would you ever need to use decorators in Python? Have you ever had\nthe task when you need to use one function in few places and you really\nwanted to avoid of code duplicating? For example to add some logging\ninto functions or timers, etc. Decorators in Python are super powerful\nwith these tasks, but at the same time they are super complicated,\nsometimes even magical. When I started learning Python, Decorators were\nreally like a magic: how to use them, how are they working, lots of\nquestions. The goal is to make the things easier and clear to answer a\nquestion: to use or not to use Decorators in your project.\n",
