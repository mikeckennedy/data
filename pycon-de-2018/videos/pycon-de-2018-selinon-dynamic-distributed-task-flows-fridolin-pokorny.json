As we discovered all the limitations, we decided to implement\nSelinon.\n\nSelinon enhances Celery task flow management and allows you to create\nand model task flows in your distributed environment that can\ndynamically change behavior based on computed results in your cluster,\nautomatically resolve tasks that need to be executed in case of\nselective task runs, automatic tracing mechanism and many others.\n",
