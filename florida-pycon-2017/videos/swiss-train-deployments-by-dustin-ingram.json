  "description": "A Swiss Train deployment is a general-purpose deployment philosophy\nbased on ideas from the Ember.js development process, modern browser\nreleases, and various open-source project releases, such as the Ubuntu\nproject.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore the motivation for a Swiss Train style\ndeployment, the problems which it seeks to solve in existing deployment\nphilosophies, and the core philosophy of a Swiss Train deployment.\n\nThis talk is for developers who are responsible for deploying code (not\njust Python!) to production in a timely manner, while still providing a\nstable ecosystem for their users.\n\nThe only background knowledge required is some amount of experience\n\u201cdeploying\u201d code or releasing applications, whatever that may mean for\nan individual developer (essentially, this will allow the audience\nmember to better empathize with the inefficiencies of current deployment\nphilosophies (or lack thereof) and highlight the advantage of the\nproposed philosophy.\n\nAfter watching this talk, the audience should be able to: \u2013 understand\nwhy it is important to have a deployment philosophy \u2013 see the\ninefficiencies in current deployment philosophies \u2013 present a strong\nargument for adopting Swiss Train style deployments \u2013 be able to\nimplement the deployment philosophy in their own workflow.",
