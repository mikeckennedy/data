  "summary": "This talk is aimed at people who maintain Python libraries and also\nusers of Debian packaged libraries. (Wherever I say Debian in this\nabstract, it applies to Ubuntu too). The talk should explain a bit about\nhow and why libraries are packaged in Debian, and how to help maintain\n(or contribute) packages you care about. We'll cover a bit of history of\nthe Python stacks in Debian and how packaged modules are provided, and\nwho does the work. For context, we'll take a quick detour into Debian\npackaging in general, and the Debian project's lifecycle. Debian\nrecently gained a new Python packaging tool, pybuild. This finally makes\nit easy to package the same library for Python 2, 3, and even PyPy. So,\nwe'll have a look at what it does, and some example packaging.\n",
