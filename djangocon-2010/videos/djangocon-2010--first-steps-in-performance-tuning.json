  "description": "So you've built your first Django website. You've tested it, you've\nreleased it, you've got a few customers... and a few more... and a few\nmore... and now you're having performance problems. What do you do? This\ntalk will look at some performance problems you may experience, and show\nsome simple (and creative) ways to squeeze the most out of your server\nhardware.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe talk is especially aimed at web developers that haven't got a\nbackground in computing, but nonetheless have fallen into a web\ndevelopment role. Topics will include:\n\n-  How to work out that you have a problem\n-  Getting computation out of the request/response loop\n-  Caching -- when, how, and problems that caching introduces\n-  Setting up a webserver to avoid deadlocks\n-  Likely causes (and solutions) of database bottlenecks\n\n",
