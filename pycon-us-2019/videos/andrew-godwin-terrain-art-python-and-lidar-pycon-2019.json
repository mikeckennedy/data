  "description": "Seeing the Earth from above is truly breathtaking, but it takes a lot of\ntime, fuel and opportunity - so instead, why not make miniature art of\nthe world's famous terrains?\n\nThis talk explores using Python to take raw terrain data - from aerial\nlidar and space-based radar scans - and processing it into 3D models,\nand CAD/CAM toolpaths, with the ultimate result of making Python-powered\nartwork of some of Earth's natural wonders.\n\nSee how to reduce each National Park to a small, intricately-milled\nmetal carving, how to laser-cut a side-on relief of a whole Hawaiian\nisland, or how to 3D print tiny versions of cities where you can make\nout each individual building - and the strengths and challenges of using\nPython to handle 3D and GIS data.\n\nWe'll also look at some basic 3D modelling code, discuss the wonders of\ndifferent map projections, and how personal LiDAR is slowly, but surely,\nbecoming affordable.\n",
