  "description": "From the perspective of a PyMC and TFP developer, I will give a developer introduction of PyMC3, and talk about some of our current design pitfall and future direction(s). I hope that with these insights and consideration of how a modern (i.e., depending on some autograd system) probabilistic libraries is designed, it could help user and practitioner to write better probabilistic programs.",
