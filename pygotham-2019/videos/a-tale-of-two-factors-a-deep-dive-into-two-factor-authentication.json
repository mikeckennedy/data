  "description": "Join us as we explore the modern landscape of Two Factor Authentication\n(2FA). This talk will discuss the history of authentication, why 2FA is a\nnecessary security layer, and introduce the different types of factors\navailable.\n\nWe'll dive into a detailed comparison of methods like SMS, Soft Tokens, Push\nAuthentication, and YubiKeys. From cryptographic security strength to user\nexperience, we will break down the benefits and downsides for the different\nmethods and provide guidance for choosing the right methods for your\nbusiness. Finally, the session will walk through example Python code for\nimplementing time-based one time passcodes (Soft Tokens) like you see in\napps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or Duo.",
