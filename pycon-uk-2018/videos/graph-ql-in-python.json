  "description": "(A replacement for REST?)\n\nGraphQL is a recent specification that is a good replacement for REST\nAPIs. It is flexible and gives frontend developers a high degree of\ncontrol over what data they get back. It allows much faster iteration,\nwith less negotiation between front and backend developers, and\nrequiring significantly less upfront planning.\n\nIt has been used to great success at Facebook, Khan Academy, GitHub and\nmany other developer led companies.\n\nThis talk will give a brief overview of GraphQL. Followed by a deeper\ndive into Python support for it through the Graphene library. It will\nshow how GraphQL can be easily integrated into Django and Flask\nwebframeworks, and be automatically reflected from Django ORM or\nSqlAlchemy.",
