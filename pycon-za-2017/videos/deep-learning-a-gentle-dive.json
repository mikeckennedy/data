  "description": "Deep Learning has the ability to disrupt and to disrupt fast. There\nare tools and algorithms mature enough to add value in almost any\nindustry and you do not need a Math Ph.D to learn Deep Learning.\n\nIn this talk, I will briefly paint a picture of the exciting world of\nDeep Learning and then explain Deep Learning concepts using\nConvolutional Neural Networks as a base.\n\nThe last part will be a live demo of a Convolutional Neural Network\nwritten in Python doing image classification.\n",
