  "description": "After the announcement of the first direct detection of gravitational\nwaves on February 2016, the Virgo Collaboration is thriving to complete\nthe integration and commissioning of the Advanced Virgo detector in\norder to provide, as soon as possible, its decisive contribution to the\ninternational network of gravitational wave detectors. Having at least\nthree detectors working simultaneously is essential for the localization\nof the sources in the sky. In this talk I will present an overview on\nthe status of the Advanced Virgo detector highlighting the challenges\nencountered during its commissioning and how Python is helping in facing\nthem in particular for the detector supervisory control automation.\n",
