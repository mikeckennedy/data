  "summary": "FUSE allows you to fake a filesystem in your userspace without mucking\naround in the kernel. This allows you to do things like showing remote\ncloud-based backup products as local filesystems. This talk explores\nsuch an implementation for mounting a Copy.com account as a local\nfilesystem, and addresses some of the common gotchas to help you\nimplement a FUSE layer for your preferred service.\n",
