  "description": "Numerical simulation is an important part of the design and analysis of dynamical systems, and has become fundamental to the education, practice, and research of many math, science, and engineering disciplines. In this talk I will introduce SimuPy, a framework for simulating interconnected dynamical system models. SimuPy provides an open source, Python-based tool that can be used in model- and system- based design and simulation workflows. I will demonstrate how to use SimuPy to simulate canonical dynamical systems and how I have used it perform numerical studies of nonlinear tracking control in my thesis and doctoral research.",
