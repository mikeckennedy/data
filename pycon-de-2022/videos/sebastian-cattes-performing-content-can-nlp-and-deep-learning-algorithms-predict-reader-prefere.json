    "description": "Speaker:: Sebastian Cattes\n\nTrack: PyData: Natural Language Processing\nCan we predict a reader's engagement time before publishing an article?\r\n\r\nThis talk presents a use case performed together with a regional German newspaper that analyses to what extent user engagement can be understood and predicted based on an article's texts and metadata.\r\n\r\nA combination of advanced statistical and NLP deep learning models (BERT) was trained on a corpus of articles to model online reading behavior.\r\n\r\nThe talk focuses on the applied methods and shows Explainable AI techniques to get a microscopic understanding of driving mechanisms of user engagement.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/XQMVKN\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
