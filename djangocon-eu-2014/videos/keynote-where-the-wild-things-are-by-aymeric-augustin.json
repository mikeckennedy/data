  "description": "The concept of pluggable applications has been instrumental in the\ndevelopment of the Django ecosystem and the quality of Django websites.\nBut it's bare- bones: the INSTALLED\\_APPS setting simply contains a list\nof Python packages.\n\nIn February 2007, Joseph Kocherhans uploaded a patch to allow changing\nan application's label and providing a verbose name for the admin. The\nscope of this ticket quickly escalated. Eventually it became known \u2014 and\nfeared \u2014 as \"app-loading\".\n\nWith every ticket closed as a duplicate, the monster grew stronger and\nhope faded. Valiant efforts by contributors and core devs cornered the\nbeast into a cave but hardly weakened it. It was finally slain in Django\n1.7.\n\nJudging by the releases notes, the results are underwhelming. Worse,\nthey come with an annoying list of backwards-incompatibilites. What was\nthat all about?\n",
