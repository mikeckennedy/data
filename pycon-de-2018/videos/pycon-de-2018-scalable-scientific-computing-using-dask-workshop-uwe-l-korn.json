  "abstract": "Pandas and NumPy are great tools to dive through data, do analysis and\ntrain machine learning models. They provide intuitive APIs and superb\nperformance. Sadly they are both restricted to the main memory of a\nsingle machine and mostly also to a single CPU. Dask is a flexible tools\nfor parallelizing NumPy and Pandas code on a single machine or a\ncluster.\n\n*Tags:* Algorithms, Big Data, Data Science, Parallel Programming, Python\n\nScheduled on `wednesday 14:00 </schedule/#wed-14:00-lounge>`__ in room\nlounge\n",
