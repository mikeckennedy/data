  "description": "In an era of almost-unlimited textual data, accurate sentiment\nanalysis can be the key for determining if our products, services and\ncommunities are delighting or aggravating others. We'll take a look at\nthe sentiment analysis landscape in Python: touching on simple\nlibraries and approaches to try as well as more complex systems based\non machine learning.\n\n-----\n\nOverview\n-------------\n\nThis talk aims to introduce the audience to the wide array of tools\navailable in Python focused on sentiment analysis. It will cover basic\nsemantic mapping, emoticon mapping as well as some of the more recent\ndevelopments in applying neural networks, machine learning and deep\nlearning to natural language processing. Participants will also learn\nsome of the pitfalls of the different approaches and see some hands-on\ncode for sentiment analysis.\n\nOutline\n-----------\n* NLP: then and now\n* Why Emotions Are Hard\n* Simple Analysis\n* TextBlob (& other available libraries)\n* Bag of Words\n* Naive Bayes\n* Complex Analysis\n* Preprocessing with word2vec\n* Metamind & RNLN\n* Optimus & CNN\n* TensorFlow\n* Watson\n* Live Demo\n* Q&A",
