  "description": "You\u2019ve heard a lot about Neural Networks (or \u201cA.I.\u201d as your company\u2019s\nmarketing team likes to call it), and how they are solution to all of your\nproblems. Unfortunately, they\u2019re also finicky and complex. And for most\nproblems that most people deal with, they\u2019re not necessarily much better\nthan easier-to-use algorithms such as Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTs). We will\nexplain (briefly) what GBTs are, compare neural networks vs. GBTs on some\nbenchmark problems, demonstrate where Neural Nets are necessary\n(images/sound/text), and share some tips for making GBTs working even on\nthose cases.\n\nThis talk is meant for people with a cursory knowledge of machine learning,\nbut who aren\u2019t necessarily experts.",
