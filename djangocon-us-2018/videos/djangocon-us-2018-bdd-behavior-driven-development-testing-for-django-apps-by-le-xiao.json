  "description": "Unit tests focus on classes and methods while integration tests focus on\ncomponents and basic business logic. However, neither of these is\nexecuted against the full system environment nor take account of the\nsystem\u2019s behaviors as a whole. Therefore, our app will not be assured to\nwork properly in production environments if we limit our testing\napproach to only two types of tests. Incorporating BDD testing into our\napp\u2019s testing plan addresses these limitations.\n\nBDD is experiencing increasing industry adoption but can still prove\ndaunting to implement from scratch. Our talk will describe how we\nimplement a BDD framework stack by answering following questions:\n\n1. How do we design structured and reusable test code for BDD?\n2. How do we integrate BDD tests with our CI/CD pipeline?\n3. How do we speed up the execution of BDD automated tests?\n4. How do we set up our BDD framework?\n5. What are the limits of BDD testing?\n",
