  "description": "In an age where fake news is an emerging concern, digestion of\ndigital media should be assisted by informative measures that are\nexemplary of integrity, responsibility, equal representation, and a\nlack of personal agenda. Such metrics are intrinsically complex and\ntheir derivation, calculation and implementation should be handled\nwith care. At the core of developing such accountability measures is\nthe ability to ingest, process, analyze and draw insights from\ndigital media. To achieve this, Media Monitoring Africa has developed\na cloud-based platform, built on Flask, with a full Python stack, to\nautomatically ingest digital media from several countries\n(particularly South Africa and other African countries). The system\nthen performs Natural Language Processing to highlight important\nsources, topics, and entities, and allows for advanced analytics on\nthe resulting data to be performed.\n\nThis talk will present the rationale, data flow and cloud implementation\nof this platform, as well as its application to driving accountability\nand insights in South African media. The intended audience is broad,\nwhere members can see a detailed road-map of constructing a Python-based\nBig Data type system, the analyses that can be performed with it, as\nwell as the impact it can have on a society's approach to digital media.\n",
