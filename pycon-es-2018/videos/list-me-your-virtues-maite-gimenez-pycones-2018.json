  "description": "Data structures are the building blocks of mostly each piece of code that we can write.\n\nLuckily, CPython developers have come up with ingenious solutions to make the lists efficient in the standard library and release us from the tedious work of allocating and releasing memory on the bare metal. But, aren't you curious about how they work in a dynamic language like Python?\n\nIn this talk, we are going to dig deep and learn about how lists work in Python. We will learn about topics such as, the complexity that involves appending new data efficiently, how lists can store different data types, what algorithm is used to sort lists.\n\nAs a bonus track, we will briefly talk about how third-party packages like NumPy can be an excellent replacement, in some cases, of our beloved lists.\n",
