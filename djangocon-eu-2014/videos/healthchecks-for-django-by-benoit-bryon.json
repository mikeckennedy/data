  "description": "Once you deployed your project, how do you validate everything is\nrunning as expected? Then, at runtime, how do you check your site\nstatus? Or when an error occurs, how do you examine system? How do you\ndistinguish between bugs in code, issues in configuration or failures in\nthird-party services? That is what healtchecks are made for.\n\n\"Hospital\" is a healthcheck framework for Python. Let's discover how\nsmoketests and diagnosis can secure your work. Let's see how easy it is\nto integrate healthchecks with Django (or with any Python project), then\nplug the results to supervision/monitoring tools.\n\nNote: did you notice Django 1.7 introduces a system check framework? Do\nyou know about django-health-check, django-doctor or django-smoketest\nprojects? We will also consider how authors are trying to make those\nprojects converge.\n",
