  "description": "The amount of data sent to earth by meteorological satellites increases\nwith each new satellite generation. Software used by the scientific\ncommunity to interpret the data must be able to handle different file\nformats and data types, to resample/interpolate the data, to create RGB\ncomposites, and to write output in many possible formats. To do this\nquickly and easily a new python library has been created called SatPy.\nThis talk will provide a detailed overview of SatPy\u2019s features and how\nits simple interfaces can be used as an interactive research tool or in\nstable operational processing.Presenter(s): Speaker: David Hoese,\nUniversity of Wisconsin - Madison, Space Science and Engineering Center\nSpeaker: Martin Raspaud, Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological\nInstitute\n",
