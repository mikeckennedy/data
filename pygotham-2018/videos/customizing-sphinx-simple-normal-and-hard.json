  "description": "Many Python projects use Sphinx for documentation, so much so that Sphinx is like Python\u2019s secret weapon. It\u2019s a powerful, mature system for generating static content -- not just docs, but blogs and regular websites.\n\nSphinx can also be customized and extended in various ways, and here the trip gets wild and wooly. With such a venerable software stack, Sphinx can be inscrutable when you paint outside the lines.\n\nThis talk gives Sphinx civilians confidence to go beyond simply using Sphinx, towards adapting Sphinx to their needs: configuration values, local CSS and templates, installing extensions and themes, writing a small extension with a directive, and testing that extension. We\u2019ll conclude with a roundup of challenges and benefits that come with diving into Sphinx.\n\nAs the talk provides shallow treatment of a wide topic list, follow-up and hands-on instruction will be given at an open space.",
