  "description": "\"How To Make Meetings Shorter, More Productive, and More Fun!\" by: Gabrielle Hendryx-Parker\nTraditional meetings are plagued by a series of bad practices that leave participants frustrated, angry or bored out of their skulls. Whether it\u2019s a lack of clear agenda, too many participants and no decision-maker, people on their screens not paying attention, or the group going down the rabbit hole on non-critical issues, the time you are spending in this meeting isn\u2019t productive and you know it! Here\u2019s instead a different format that guarantees that meetings start and end on time, keep participants engaged, focus on key issues, and make some serious progress each time the team meets. Oh, and you\u2019ll have fun too. Sounds good? Then let\u2019s dive in.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
