  "description": "Unit and integration tests are great first steps towards improving the quality of your python project. Ever wonder if there\u2019s even more you can do?   In this talk we\u2019ll cover additional types of tests that can help improve the quality and robustness of your python projects: stateful property-based testing, generative fuzz testing, long term stability testing and advanced multithreaded testing.\n\nThis talk is more than just theory.  We'll look at specific libraries and frameworks that help you write these advanced tests.  I'll also show you real world examples of bugs these tests have found from projects that I maintain.",
