  "description": "Some applications in the market assist users to correct different\nwriting mistakes, including spelling and grammar errors. However, very\nrarely these tools are used by school teachers. For most of them, it is\nstill time- consuming and tedious to correct (beginners) student essays.\n\nThis talk will introduce some challenges in automatic English text\ncorrection. The objective is to present how it is possible to use Python\nlibraries (scikit-learn, SciPy and NumPy) for spotting English mistakes\nsuch as: articles, capitalization and spelling.\n\nIn order to train and test the classifier, an open dataset will be used:\nEF- Cambridge Open Language Dataset\n(https://corpus.mml.cam.ac.uk/efcamdat/). This will allow participants\nto reproduce all the steps.\n\nDuring the presentation, the accuracy of the implementation will be\ncompared to at least one commercial application. It will be discussed\nhow this kind of work can bring value to existing educational\napplications. Limitations and further steps will also be discussed.\n\nThis presentation is a successive work from the cooperation of Education\nFirst (language teaching institution) engineers and University of\nCambridge language researchers.\n",
