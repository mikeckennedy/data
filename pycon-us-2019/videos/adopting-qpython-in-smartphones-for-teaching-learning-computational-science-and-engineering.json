  "description": "I have been teaching undergraduate computational physics for more than a\ndecade in my university. Adopting Python as our programming language has\nreally helped because of its unique qualities which made it easily\naccessible and easy to teach/learn. However, providing enough computing\ndevices to the increasing number of students has been a serious\nchallenge. This is even more frustrating when one require to involve\nonline classroom submission/evaluation of assignments. I have overcome\nthis challenge by adopting QPython in smartphones which are rapidly\npenetrating Africa. With a built-in math library and possibility to\ninstall Numpy, QPython in smartphones has made the teaching/learning to\nmore students more efficient especially as they can now engage in\nlearning programming anywhere, anytime and anyhow. The success made me\nextend it to one of our current projects under the Python African\nComputational Science and Engineering Tour (PACSETPro) on teaching\nPython to students, new beginners as well as expert programmers in\nscience and engineering (S & E). In this talk, I gave a captivating\naccount on how to use QPython to teach computational approaches in S & E\nin a manner that advancing to normal computing systems is\nstraightforward. Highly excited by the success so far, our outlook is\nhaving both Matplotlib and QVPython in smartphones. This will be a boon\nfor teaching/learning computational approaches anywhere, anytime and\nanyhow.\n",
