  "description": "This is the story of how I (and with me, my company) went from lonely,\nintrovert, C# developer to open-source Python author and maintainer,\nspeaker, trainer, consultant, and all-around community junkie. With some\nluck, in the process, you will also hear a few hints on how to become a\ngood open source contributor and have a chance to ponder on the pros and\ncons (yes there are cons too) of going full monty with open source. We\nwill also look at what changed in my company as we slowly switched from\nclosed, in-house eco-systems to the open source field.\n",
