This tutorial is an introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD) for the world of web development in Python using the Django framework.\n\nThe tutorial is suitable for people who are new to either testing, or Django, or both, although some basic working knowledge of Python syntax (or programming in another language) is assumed.\n\nLearn about:\n\n- Unit testing and Functional testing\n- the Selenium browser automation tool\n- Python's unittest standard library module\n- Django models, views and templates\n- testing front-end and back-end code\n- refactoring, using tests\n- the unit-test/code cycle, or Red-Green-Refactor, TDD workflow\n- and the Testing Goat, Python's unofficial mascot for testing!\n\nCome prepared!  You'll need a Python 3.6 virtualenv with Django and Selenium installed.  Detailed instructions are provided `here <https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/pre-requisite-installations.html>`_.",
