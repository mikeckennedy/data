  "description": "Twisted is one of the best asynchronous network programming frameworks\nout there, and can help you build cool stuff very easily, once you\nunderstand the core design. Unfortunately, Twisted is also a huge\nframework and can be very daunting for beginners to approach. This\ntraining session aims to help people with little or no asynchronous\nprogramming experience understand both Twisted and asynchronous\nprogramming. The plan is to cover core asynchronous topics, the Twisted\nway, and as many practical applications as we can cover, including web\nservices, IPC, GUI applications etc. The audience should be competent in\ncore Python constructs. No previous asynchronous or threading\nprogramming experience required. This is a repeat of the popular\nEuroPython 2011 Twisted Tutorial, improved after feedback.\n",
