  "description": "(Matt Coles) A few years ago a small web application was built with Flask over a weekend allowing customers to order a free t-shirt for an event being hosted. It was designed for this single purpose and had never been considered to be needed or expanded beyond that.\r\n\r\nWithin the next six months, the app was adapted to allow breakfasts, hoodies, socks, pens and rubik's cubes ordered for different events.\r\n\r\nWith these new adaptions came added complexities.\n\nhttps://2021.pycon.org.au/program/HNK9YE/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country\u2019s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 15:00:00 2021 at DevOops",
