  "description": "Many projects grow to the point where distributed systems are needed - or even more excitingly, plunge into it headfirst my adopting microservices - but along with the obvious challenges of more servers and more storage, there's all sorts of hidden dangers that you might never even have planned for.\n\nLearn about the wonders of hardware issues, networks that can't even fail correctly, delivery tradeoffs, cosmic rays and problems with time itself, and how you can be a bit more prepared for these sorts of challenges in the future - even if you're still a small project.",
