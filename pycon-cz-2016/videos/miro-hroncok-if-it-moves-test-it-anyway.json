  "description": "If it Moves, Test it Anyway\n\nNow you write tests and you want them to be part of the project, run on your CI etc., but:\n\n* the API is secured by a secret token/password/cookie...\n* the information on the webpage changes\n* it's not even accessible from the wild web\n\nSo how do you test it? You can mock the server part (that's messy),\nyou can spin off your own testing server (that's hard) or you can\nrecord the HTTP communication with betamax (that's super simple).\nI'll show you all the methods and their good, bad and ugly parts.",
