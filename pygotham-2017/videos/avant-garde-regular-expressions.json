  "description": "Don\u2019t settle on being just regular! In this fast-paced talk, you will learn how to create advanced regular expressions, as well as powerful and unconventional nuances to using them.\n\nI will introduce verbose expressions, lookahead assertions, greedy expressions, multi-line expressions, locale-aware expressions and more, with many code examples. I will introduce robust ways to use regular expressions, including named groups and returning matches as an Iterator.\n\nI will briefly highlight multiple-expression design practices, testing, developer tooling, and even historical origins of the name.\n\nBeginner-level regular expression familiarity is assumed. Please join me!",
