  "description": "Being born with Cerebral Palsy has presented me with many challenges\nthankfully, we are in the grips of a technical revolution and it may\nsurprise you how much of this technology has had a massive impact on my\nlife and enabled my independence to be greatly improved.\n\nMy love of technology has helped me to embrace many things from social\nnetworking to smart assistants to improve my life including, in my\nprofessional work where I use a Python library to partially code by\nusing my voice.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the label of assistive technology and why\nmore technologies than you would traditionally think in my view are\nassistive. I will also discuss the risks forced upon me to achieve that\nlevel of independence and where I believe the technology of the future\nhas a role to play in further increasing my independence.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nTom is a Computing student at Bournemouth University in South West\nEngland. Despite being born with Quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy he has used\nhis love and passion for technology to propel himself forward, grounded\nin a firm interest of current affairs and the world around him. Tom is\ncurrently looking for opportunities to combine both of these passions.\n",
