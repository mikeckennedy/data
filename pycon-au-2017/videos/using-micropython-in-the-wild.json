  "description": "MicroPython is a complete reimplementation of Python that runs on small devices like microcontrollers.  It enables users to build cool stuff - like Internet of Things devices - by combining their existing Python knowledge with a little bit of hands-on hardware hacking.  In this talk I will start with a brief overview of MicroPython, how it works, how you can try it out, and how you can use it.  I will then discuss some of the technical advances in the MicroPython software that have occurred over the past 12 months.  Finally, I will talk about some of the things MicroPython is being used for, from robotics to IoT.",
