  "description": "GraphQL query language is gaining popularity and seeing more adoption.\nThis is mainly due to the efficiency with which consumers can get their\ndata, the ease with which you can document and explore your API and the\npowerful tooling that has been built around the query language.\n\nThis talk is for novices and experts of GraphQL alike and aims to cover\nthe basics of the query language, how to implement it using Flask and\nSQLAlchemy and to take a deeper dive into how Python\u2019s type-hinting can\nbe used to generate your GraphQL schema.\n\nI\u2019ll also be talking about some of the tooling that can be used to\nprovide consumers and developers working on your API with a great\ndevelopment experience. Next I\u2019ll cover some ways you can use these\ntools to empower your development process and get you developing \u2018API\nFirst\u2019.\n\nTo get the most out of this talk you should have a general understanding\nof APIs, Python frameworks and Python ORMs. However, my aim is to make\nit as accessible as possible for developers of all experience levels.\n",
