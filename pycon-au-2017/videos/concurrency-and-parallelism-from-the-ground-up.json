  "description": "When writing an application, it is common to want to do many things at once. For web servers, this is serve multiple web requests, for GUI applications it's doing a background task whilst keeping the UI responsive. But how do we actually do that? This talk will go into how concurrency and parallelism work from the CPU, OS, and threads up, how state (data) is shared between them, and how this interacts with the functions that you, the programmer, write, and how you can write properly behaving concurrent or parallel software.",
