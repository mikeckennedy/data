  "description": "Unit tests are great, but they don\u2019t catch all bugs because they don\u2019t test\nfeatures like a user. However, Web UI tests are complicated and notoriously\nunreliable. So, how can we write tests well? Never fear!\n\nLet\u2019s learn how to write robust, scalable Web UI tests using Python, pytest,\nand Selenium WebDriver that cover the full stack for any Web app. In this talk,\nwe will write one simple test together that covers DuckDuckGo searching.\nWe\u2019ll cover:\n\n* Using Selenium WebDriver like a pro\n* Modeling Web UI interactions in Python code\n* Writing \u201cgood\u201d feature tests that are efficient, robust, and readable\n* Deciding what should and should not be tested with automation\n\n\nAfter this talk, you\u2019ll know how to write battle-hardened Web UI tests for\nanyWeb app, including Django and Flask apps. I\u2019ll provide the example code on\nGitHub, as well as plenty of hands-on tutorials and resources to continue\nlearning after this talk.",
