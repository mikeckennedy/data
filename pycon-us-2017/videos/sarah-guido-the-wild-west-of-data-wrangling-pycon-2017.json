  "description": "Data science introductory courses might give you the impression that\ndealing with data is neat, tidy, and simple. They present you with a\nsimplistic dataset and the scikit-learn or Pandas documentation, and a\nday or so later, you're done! Piece of cake, right?\n\nThe real world of data isn't that easy!\n\nAs a data scientist who has worked in the industry for several years, I\nhave had a lot of experience dealing with messy, inaccurate, incomplete\ndata, and I want to share those experiences with you. I'll talk my way\nthrough three real-world situations where I've had to analyze and build\nmodels on untidy and complex data, going through how I've preprocessed\nthe data and prepared it for modeling. You'll leave with an\nunderstanding of how a data scientist thinks about data and what she\ndoes when the data is complicated.\n",
