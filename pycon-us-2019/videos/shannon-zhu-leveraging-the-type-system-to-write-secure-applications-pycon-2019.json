  "description": "Application security remains a long-term and high-stakes problem for\nmost projects that interact with external users. Python's type system is\nalready widely used for readability, refactoring, and bug detection \u2014\nthis talk will demonstrate how types can also be leveraged to make your\nproject systematically more secure. We'll investigate (1) how static\ntype checkers like Pyre or MyPy can be extended with simple library\nmodifications to catch vulnerable patterns, and (2) how deeper\ntype-based static analysis can reliably flag remaining use cases to\nsecurity engineers. As an example, I'll focus on a basic security\nproblem and how you might use both tools in combination, drawing from\nour experience deploying these methods to build more secure applications\nat Facebook and Instagram.\n",
