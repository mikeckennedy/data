  "summary": "Django's testrunner gets you started quickly, but you soon hit your head\non its limitations as your project grows. By trading it for nose, a\ntesting framework popular in the wider Python community, we can reduce\nboilerplate, boost performance, and improve testing UI, with only a few\nlines of setting changes. Re-use your test DBs, integrate with Jenkins,\nsplit your suite into pieces, and more.\n",
