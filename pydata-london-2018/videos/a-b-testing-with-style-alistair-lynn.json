  "abstract": "A/B testing is one of the most powerful tools in the e-commerce arsenal.\nThe data-driven approach which it enables played a strong part in making\nAmazon and Google successful. Arguably, A/B testing even led to the\nelection of Barack Obama. There have been many (generally\nself-righteous) blog posts extolling its virtues.\n\nIn this talk I'll instead dig into the actual mechanics of how we run\nand understand A/B tests at Thread. I'll introduce our open-source A/B\ntesting tool, Jacquard, and its design, with a practical demo. I'll also\ndig into how we interpret and understand the information that comes from\nour tests. We use Bayesian statistics and present our results in an\nunorthodox way.\n\nI'll also explore some of the risks of testing. There are some tricky\npitfalls and dangers to be aware of. There's also the many ways to\ninvalidate the results of a test, and a huge number of biases to be\naware of. I will then add some dire-sounding warnings about trusting A/B\ntests too much.\n",
