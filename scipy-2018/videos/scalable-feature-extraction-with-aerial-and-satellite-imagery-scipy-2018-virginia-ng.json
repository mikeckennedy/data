  "description": "In this talk we introduce use cases for feature extraction with aerial\nand satellite imagery such as turn lane marking detection, road and\nbuilding footprint detection. In doing so, we show the potential of\nlarge-scale object detection and segmentation on aerial and satellite\nimagery. We give insights into how imagery training sets can be built\nwith little or no human annotations needed making use of available\ndatasets such as OpenStreetMap. We then focus on modeling aspects for\nobject detection and segmentation. In doing so we give an insight into\nstate-of-the-art detection systems and adaptions we had to make for the\naerial and satellite imagery domain. We conclude the talk with lessons\nlearned in building these large-scale object detection and segmentation\npipelines, and show potential for future work in this domain.
