  "description": "batou is a service deployment utility inspired by tools like Puppet,\nFabric, and other modern tools. It made a short appearance in a\nlightning talk and at the sprints during EP 2012.\n\nThe talk gives an overview and demonstrates with practical examples how\nwe deploy web applications with many complex components:\n\n-  modelling service components with Python\n-  multiple environments\n-  multiple platforms\n-  development environments\n-  convergent behaviour\n-  remote deployments\n-  secrets management (database passwords, SSL certificates, \u2026)\n-  no additional run-time dependencies\n\nI will show how the real-life requirements in our projects led us to\ndevelop a general model that integrates existing practices without\nbuilding a huge stack of technologies.\n",
