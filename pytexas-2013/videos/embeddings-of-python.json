  "description": "James Powell is a Python programmer residing in New York City. He is the co-organiser of the NYC Python meetup (nycpython.com) and has spoken at PyData SV, PyData NYC, PyTexas, PyArkansas, PyGotham, and at the NYC Python meetup. He also authors a blog on Python topics at dontusethiscode.com\n\n\nThis talk discusses embeddings of Python: the known \"high-level embedding\": whole interpreter running within a C/C++ application using PyRun_SimpleString; a novel \"medium-level embedding\": (potentially) zero-interpreter embedding within a C/C++ application using Cython for translation; a novel \"Python with Python embedding\": running a Python interpreter from within a Python module, within the same process (with split/hybrid GC & PyObject shims)",
