  "description": "PyPy is a Python implementation, alternative to the standard CPython.\nPyPy comes with a JIT (Just-in-Time compiler). We'll see the recent\ndevelopments:\n\n-  PyPy now supports either Python 2.7 or (in beta) Python 3.5.\n\n-  Numpy and the scientific stack are getting ever closer to fully\n   working.\n\nWe will also mention a potential future direction: getting rid of the\nGIL (Global Interpreter Lock). The Python community has been discussing\nremoving the GIL for a long time, with no success so far. Targeting PyPy\ninstead of CPython would still be quite involved, but more doable.\n",
