  "description": "Internet service providers, ad networks, governments\u2026 Many organizations\nhave increasing access to our personal information. Protecting privacy\nin this environment is a non-trivial effort, and the threats posed by\nmalicious attackers further exacerbates this problem. We, as developers,\nowe it to ourselves and to our communities to do the best we can to\nimprove our collective security and privacy.\n\nAttendees of this talk will walk away with a thorough understanding of\nthe following topics and the problems they solve:\n\n-  multi-factor authentication\n-  encrypted DNS\n-  SSH/VPN tunnels\n-  full disk encryption\n-  compartment isolation\n-  \u201conion-skin\u201d routing\n\nIn addition, digital interactions with other people increasingly occur\nvia hosted services, which while convenient can compromise the privacy,\nintegrity, and control of our data. With some open-source software and\ninexpensive virtual servers, we can take back control and empower us all\nto securely share our lives with one another.\n",
