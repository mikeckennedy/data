  "description": "Cooperative Multitasking with Twisted: Getting Things Done Concurrently\n\nPresented by David A Reid\n\nTwisted is a framework for building asynchronous networking\napplications. It also provides powerful tools for writing non-blocking\nnon-network code, tools which are vital for building real large scale\napplications in Twisted. I hope to give a comprehensive overview of\nthese tools to help the intermediate Twisted user get things done\nconcurrently.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Picture out of focus at the beginning]\n",
