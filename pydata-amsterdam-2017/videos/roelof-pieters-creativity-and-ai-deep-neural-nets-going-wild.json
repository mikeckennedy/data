This talk will make sense of the explosion of research and experiments that deal with creativity and A.I. and take you through the wonderful trippy world of neural nets \"going wild\" with their dancing moves, freestyle raps, impressionist paintings. and show some of the exciting possibilities new technologies offer for creative use and explorations of human-machine interaction, where the main theorem is \"augmentation, not automation\". The talk will particularly focus on \"generative\" models, and show the python fanatic how to make your move with these particular forms of Deep Neural Nets, to then finish with an \"experiment\".",
