I\u2019ll give you just\nlike a couple of seconds to go through that.\n\nThis topic is a bit hard for me as it covers some of the things I\u2019ve\ngone through in my career that made me feel like an idiot when they\nhappened. With time, I\u2019ve realized that these are the things that have\ntaken me where I\u2019m at and I hope they will be useful to you as they were\nfor me. I don\u2019t intend to look smart but rather be honest, as honest as\nI can be about my past so that you can, perhaps, start ahead.\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 20 April** at 09:00 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
