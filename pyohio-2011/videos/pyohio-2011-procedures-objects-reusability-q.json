  "description": "Procedures, Objects, Reusability: httplib, urllib2 and their discontents\n\nPresented by Brandon Craig Rhodes\n\nPython supports two major programming paradigms: procedures, and object\norientation. This talk will claim that, when it comes to code re-use,\nthese two paradigms are NOT created equal: because object-oriented\nprogramming encourages the programmer to write methods that consider\neverything else inside of \"self\" to be fair game, it encourages highly\ncoupled code that proves brittle when extended.\n",
