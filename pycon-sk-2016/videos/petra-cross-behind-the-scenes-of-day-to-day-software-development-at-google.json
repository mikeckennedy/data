  "description": "It is estimated that in the US alone, failed and troubled software\nprojects waste $60-$70 billion per year. For that money, you could\nlaunch the space shuttle 100 times, build and deploy the entire 24\nsatellite GPS, and develop the Boeing 777 from scratch and still have\nfew billion left over.\n\nIn my talk, I will not be analyzing what other companies do wrong.\nInstead, I will focus on explaining what Google does to reduce the\ndevelopment cost while speeding up releases and constantly delivering\nhigh-quality software to our users. I will touch upon various software\ndevelopment workflow methodologies and then dive into the specifics of\nwhat software teams at Google do on a day- to-day basis.\n",
