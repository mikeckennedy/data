  "description": "A retrospective and prospective of Python\u2019s adoption in the\n**data-driven industries** and how it has and should influence its\necosystem and communities.\n\nThanks to its versatility, Python\u2019s usage and adoption has changed a lot\nover the last decade to go beyond the very act of software programming.\n\nFrom Developers to SysOps, closely followed by Scientists and Data\nanalysts, Python has spread to become a common tongue for a wide range\nof people.\n\nWe will start by looking at how this increased adoption impacted Python\necosystem and is still shaping it today. While **this talk is not walk\nthrough all the Python technologies around data** , some of them will be\noutlined so you will hear words like Numpy, Pandas or Jupyter.\n\nThen we will try to project ourselves in the future and by\n**highlighting the pitfalls Python has to overcome** to keep up with its\npace and mature in its ability to **scale**!\n\nDraft of the agenda\n\n-  The rise and collusion of science and engineering and their influence\n   on Python\n-  From DevOps to DataOps, the shape and breakthroughs of Python\u2019s\n   ecosystem\n-  Prospect of challenges and pitfalls in the massive data era\n",
