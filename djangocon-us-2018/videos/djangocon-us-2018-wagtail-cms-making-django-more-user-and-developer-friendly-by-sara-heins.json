  "description": "Django is a robust framework that can handle a lot of complex problems.\nHowever, if your goal is to get a simple marketing website up and\nrunning, it can be a little too complicated - especially for beginners\nwho are new to frameworks. The admin itself can also appear clunky and\nconfusing to users, and the path to creating a new type of page is paved\nwith views, urls, templates and more!\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice to have an intuitive UI for the admin, and a quick,\ntemplated way to create pages in just a few lines of code?\n\nEnter Wagtail - a simple, yet elegant, content management system. With a\nbeautiful admin (great for your clients), a Page class that abstracts\nthings like url structures and views (great for beginners) and built-in\nWYSIWYG page models (great for on-the-fly content customization), you\ncan focus on getting a flexible site up and running while still having\nthe power of Django to solve complex problems (like querying) when you\nneed it.\n\nThis talk will teach you the basics of how Wagtail can save you time and\neffort by not re-inventing the CMS wheel. It\u2019s aimed at anyone who wants\na more user-friendly, out-of-the-box CMS, whether you\u2019re a beginner who\nis struggling to grasp the concepts of a framework or a seasoned\ndeveloper looking to streamline this aspect of your project.\n",
