  "description": "A novel method for detecting solar panels and its geometry on aerial imagery is presented. Deep Learning with PyTorch is being used for segmentation. The goal is to know the exact locations, dimensions and potential of every solar installation in Switzerland. It is shown how we labelled the data and how we found a solution to distinguish different solar panel types.",
