  "description": "\"Reinventing the wheel is great if your goal is to learn more about\n    wheels.\" -- James Tauber\n\nIf you're building a web app, you probably reach for your favorite\nframework -- Django, Flask, Pyramid, etc. But we rarely stop to think\nabout what these tools are doing under the hood. In this hands-on\ntutorial, you'll gain a deeper understanding of what frameworks are and\nhow they work by implementing your own framework from scratch. We'll\nbuild a complete (if minimal) web framework that handles the WSGI\nrequest/response cycle, routing, controllers, templating, and a data\nlayer. Along the way you'll gain a deeper understanding of the decisions\nweb frameworks make, their relative merits, and inner workings.\n",
