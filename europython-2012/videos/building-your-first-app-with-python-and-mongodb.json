  "description": "MongoDB - from \u201chumongous\u201d - is an open source, non-relational,\ndocument- oriented database. Trading off a few traditional features of\ndatabases (Notably joins and transactions) in order to Achieve much\nbetter performance, MongoDB is fast, scalable, and designed for web\ndevelopment. The goal of the project is MongoDB to bridge the gap\nbetween key-value stores (which are fast and highly scalable) and\ntraditional RDBMS systems (which queries Provide rich and deep\nfunctionality). This talk will introduce the rich feature set of mongoDB\nand examine how easy it is to develop with using python. We\u2019ll discuss\nthe various ODM\u2019s solutions that really let you develop quickly and how\nmongoDB can be used to easily scale.\n",
