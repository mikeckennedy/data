  "description": "How we teach, rather than what we teach, often has the most impact on\nwho participates and on learning outcomes. This presentation covers\ntrends in computational teaching, and focuses on how these trends relate\nto diversity, inclusion, equity, and access to computational training.\nThrough the lens of The Carpentries, an organization dedicated to\nteaching foundational coding and data science skills worldwide, we\npresent best practices and opportunities for improvement in\ncomputational teaching pedagogy. Evidence-based teaching practices,\n\u201ctrain-the-trainer\u201d programs, and mentoring are three strategies we\noutline that support inclusive pedagogy in computational teaching. We\ndescribe and discuss effective teaching practices that promote inclusive\npedagogy in computational teaching, including formative assessment,\ncollaborative note taking, a strong commitment to a Code of Conduct, and\ncreating a welcoming environment for learners.\n",
