    "description": "Speaker:: Emeli Dral\n\nTrack: PyData: Machine Learning & Stats\nWhen your ML model is in production, you might observe input data and prediction drift. In absence of ground truth, drift can serve as a proxy for the model performance. But how exactly to evaluate it? In this talk, I will give an overview of the possible approaches, and how to implement and visualize the results.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/ASW8CJ\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
