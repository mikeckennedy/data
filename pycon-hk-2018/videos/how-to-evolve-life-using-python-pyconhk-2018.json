  "description": "In this talk I will demonstrate how to create Artificial Life in a\ncomputer using Python and its wonderful libraries.\n\nThe Python program, called \u201cLenia\u201d, is developed to discover/evolve new\nlife species, using its interactive UI to facilitate Evolutionary\nAlgorithms (EA). A video recorded from the program won the Virtual\nCreatures Contest in GECCO conference 2018, Kyoto.\n\n| It utilizes the following libraries:\n| \u2013 NumPy for matrix calculation\n| \u2013 PyOpenCL/PyCUDA and Reikna for GPU acceleration \u2013 SciPy and\n  PIL/Pillow for image processing\n| \u2013 Tkinter (and potentially Matplotlib) for interactive UI \u2013 Subprocess\n  and FFmpeg for real-time video\n\nLenia is now open source at https://github.com/Chakazul/Lenia\n",
