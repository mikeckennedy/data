  "description": "In a world full of user generated media content, automated image and\nvideo processing plays a prominent role, both in social media apps\n(face, object, and place detection), and in local applications that\nautomatically sort media collections, among other uses. In the last\nfew years, a number of startups such as Clarifai and Indico, and much\nbigger players such as Google and Microsoft, have launched their own\n'machine learning as a service' offerings, including 'vision' products\nthat can recognise objects present in image and video footage and\nautomatically tag them, provide optical character recognition (OCR)\nservices, and even not safe for work (NSFW) classifiers that can be\nused to omit content from internal networks.\n\nThis talk will focus on 'food' recognition within images, and will\nwalk through the basics of how to get started with image\nclassification, from using APIs and SDKs for some of the commercial\n(but free) offerings available, to trying and recreate those services\nlocally, first by walking through and example of the 'bag of features'\ntechnique, using a mix of supervised and unsupervised methods in\nscikit-learn and OpenCV, and secondly showing examples based on\n'transfer learning', a 'deep learning' technique to reuse pre-trained\nconvolutional neural networks to customise classification from smaller\ntraining datasets.\n",
