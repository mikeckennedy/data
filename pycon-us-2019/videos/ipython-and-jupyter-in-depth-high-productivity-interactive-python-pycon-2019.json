  "description": "IPython and Jupyter provide tools for interactive computing that are\nwidely used in scientific computing, education, and data science, but\ncan benefit any Python developer.\n\nIn this tutorial we will introduce you to the latest developement in\nIPython and Jupyter, get you up to speed on how to install jupyter on\nyour machine and where to seek help for larger deployment. Then we will\ndive into intermediate features that makes the power of IPython and\nJupyter.\n\nWe will dive into how to make the best use of features like\n\n-  Async REPL (New in IPython 7)\n-  And how to tie that into the Visualisation capabilities of Jupyter,\n   and the new JupyterLab interface.\n-  Widgets (building simple interactive dashboards based on ipywidgets)\n-  Magics\n-  Multilanguage integration,\n\nThe notebooks also allow for code in multiple languages allowing to mix\nPython with Cython, C, R and other programming languages to access\nfeatures hard to obtain from Python.\n\nMore info\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nFor full details about IPython including documentation, previous\npresentations and videos of talks, please see `the project\nwebsite <http://ipython.org>`__.\n\nThe materials for this tutorial will be `available on a github\nrepository <https://github.com/ipython/ipython-in-depth>`__.\n",
