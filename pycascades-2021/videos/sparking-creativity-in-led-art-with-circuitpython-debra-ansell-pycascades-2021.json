  "description": "Debra Ansell has been building LED art and wearables for over a decade. The advent of CircuitPython - a variant of Python built to run on small microcontrollers and interact easily with hardware - has helped to facilitate her creative process by making it cheap and simple to quickly iterate and prototype new designs. Many CircuitPython modules exist which allow creators to control different types and configurations of LEDs with only a few lines of code. Debra will display some of her works and discuss how she uses CircuitPython in her creations.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycascades-2021/talk/HBSZN7/\n\nAfter three amazing in-person conferences, this time we're moving PyCascades online.\r\n\r\nPyCascades is a regional PyCon in the Pacific Northwest, celebrating the west coast Python developer and user community. Our organizing team includes members of the Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland Python user groups.\r\n\r\nVideos are released as CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#pycascades #pycon #python #conference\n\nSat Feb 20 13:15:00 2021 at Interactive Track",
