  "description": "You've got some data, and now you want to analyze it with Python. You're\non your way to greatness! Now the problem comes: do I do the t-test?\nChi-squared test? How do I decide? In this talk, inspired by many\nPythonista Bayesians (@jakevdp, @allendowney, @twiecki, @fonnesbeck)\nbefore, I will show you how you can take common statistical decision\nproblems, formulate them as a Bayesian analysis problem, and use PyMC3\nas your workhorse tool for gaining insights. This talk will be\nmath-light and code-heavy, and if you download the slides, you'll have a\nsimple template for more complex Bayesian analysis down the road!\n",
