  "description": "One of the most dreaded questions a freelancer hears is \"Okay, so how long\ndo you think this will take you?\"  Without tons of experience and deep self-\nawareness, it's always hard to size up a data project.  Even with\nexperience, sometimes there are spectacular failures.  Let's have a fun\ndiscussion about a few key ways to size up a project, including how to ask\ngood scoping questions, how to budget for unexpected and time-consuming\nscenarios.  The discussion will also be liberally sprinkled with personal\nanecdotes of scoping failures from my career as a data freelancer.",
