  "description": "Jupyter widgets are powerful tools for building user interfaces with graphical controls such as sliders and text boxes inside a Jupyter notebook. Interactive widgets can also be rendered in Sphinx documentation, nbviewer, and static web pages. Jupyter widgets are more than a collection of controls, they also are a framework that makes it easy to build custom GUI controls. Examples of custom widget packages include libraries for interactive 2-D charting (bqplot), 3-D graphics (pythreejs, ipyvolume), mapping (ipyleaflet), and more.",
