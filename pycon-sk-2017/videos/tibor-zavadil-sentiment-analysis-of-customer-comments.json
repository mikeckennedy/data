  "description": "Analysis of customer satisfaction has become a key topic for many companies. I perform sentiment analysis in Python using various open-source libraries (such as NLTK and Scikit-learn). This involves natural language processing, vectorization, feature selection, choice of appropriate classifier and parameter grid search. Using real business data I managed to achieve the accuracy of correct sentiment detection at around 90%.",
