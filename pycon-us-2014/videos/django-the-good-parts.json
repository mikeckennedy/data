  "summary": "Lots of talks and tutorials try to cover Django exhaustively, going over\nevery component and feature. But not so many take a look at the bits\nthat let Django be Django. In this talk, we'll see exactly what those\nbits -- some old, some new -- are, in a way that shows why it's still a\nsolid and popular choice for web developers nearly nine years after its\ninitial public release.\n",
