  "description": "Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH is the leading manufacturer of lithography optics.\nOur optics allow chipmakers to produce smaller, faster and more energy\nefficient computer chips. As we move to smaller and smaller structures,\nthe necessary optics grow more and more complex. Customized simulations\nand data analytics by highly qualified technical domain experts are\nessential. These people are not experienced software developers.\nHowever, with Python and the right support, we can give them powerful\ntools to accomplish their task efficiently.\n\nPioneering Python in a larger enterprise can be challenging. At present,\nwe use Python in selected areas of our product development and\nproduction processes. We'd like to share our challenges and solutions\nwith using Python in a heterogeneous company environment. In particular,\nhow can we make Python accessible to non-programmers? How do we ensure\nconsistent development? How do we embed in the non-Python ecosystem of\nthe company?\n",
