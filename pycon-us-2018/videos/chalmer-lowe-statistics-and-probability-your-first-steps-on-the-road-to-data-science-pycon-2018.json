  "description": "An introduction to statistics and probability geared toward enabling attendees to understand the capabilities and limitations of statistics and probability and to help them implement calculations in their projects. Where possible/feasible, attendees will build their own tools to help them grasp the underlying concepts. In addition, attendees will be introduced to the pre-built tools in world-class Python and data science libraries to help them capitalize on the efficiencies and utility that those libraries offer.",
