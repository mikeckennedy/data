  "description": "We used ``Flask`` to build out the API backend for an Android app that's\nscaled up to > *200,000* users. With an iOS app that's in development,\nwe expect this to soon double.\n\nWe've learnt a ton of little things along the way, and have had to make\nvarious architectural and design decisions. In my experience, it's easy\nto google and find a lot of information on SO or HN, but it's not always\neasy to put these in context to see what's really relevant to you. In\nthis talk, I'll attempt to talk through the *why* behind various choices\nwe made, and engage in *dialog* about how these may be beneficial to you\n(or not).\n\n`Slides <https://web.archive.org/web/20140618164101/http://slid.es/arg0s/chugging-%20flask>`__\n\nI've provided a link to my slides to serve as an outline that I hope\nwill open up dialog with others, and help steer the direction of this\ntalk. Feedback and suggestions are welcome, just mention your\ntwitter/irc handle in your comments if you'd like to discuss things.",
