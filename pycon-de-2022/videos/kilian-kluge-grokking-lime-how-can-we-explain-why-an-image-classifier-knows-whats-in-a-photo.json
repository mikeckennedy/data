    "description": "Speaker:: Kilian Kluge\n\nTrack: PyData: Computer Vision\nMany machine learning models are too complex for humans to comprehend. Algorithms like LIME can explain model outputs, even without looking at a model\u2019s internal structure. This talk provides attendees with a deep understanding of this approach.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/ZJUWZJ\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
