  "description": "Take your machine learning model out of your desk drawer and show its\nbenefit to the world through a simple API using AWS Lambda and API\ngateway. This tutorial will bridge the gap between having a machine\nlearning model (e.g. in your Jupyter notebooks) and taking it to a level\nwhere others can benefit from it (i.e. through an API).\n",
