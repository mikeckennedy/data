  "description": "Data scientists work with all kinds of data, It could be a text an image or\nmaybe it is a bunch of coordinates. Though computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing have hit it off spatial data science doesn\u2019t get the\nattention it deserves. Spatial data has both social and industrial impact.\nSpatial data is useful in agriculture and for observing weather patterns to\npredict natural disasters. It is also very important for industries that\ndeal with logistics and supply chain management.\n\nIn this talk I would talk about spatial data it\u2019s importance and elaborate\non how to store, manipulate and visualize such data. I would talk about the\nuse of Python and several related modules (GDAL, Shapely, Fiona etc) in\nprocessing geospatial data. I would also like to discuss QGIS, a desktop\nbased open source GIS platform and a variety of useful operations that can\nbe done with it. I would also like to talk about building geospatial\ndashboards to share and serve  spatial layers and discuss the geospatial\nsupport provided by the various open source projects like postgis, geonode,\nelastic stack V7.0 and much more",
