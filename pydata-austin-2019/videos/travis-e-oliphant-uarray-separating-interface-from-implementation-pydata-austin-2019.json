  "description": "NumPy is an array implementation that is slowly also becoming an interface/API. This leaves users with no way to express their intent; increasing technical debt and making fundamental improvements difficult. Separating interface from implementation is beneficial for the community. We talk about efforts in NumPy itself, why they are insufficient, and how uarray proposes to solve the problem.",
