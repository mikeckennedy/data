  "description": "In 2012 the SKA SA Control and Monitoring (CAM) gave a talk at\nPyConZA and it can be viewed at this `Youtube Video\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN5cMyZucKI>`__ and more info at\n`PyConZA 2012 link\n<https://2012.za.pycon.org/speaker/27/detail.html>`__.\n\n5 years later, Python is still used for Controlling and Monitoring of\nthis world-class instrument, that is on its path to being the most\nsensitive radio telescope in the southern hemisphere. The 64 dish array\ncompletion is around the corner and we take a look back at the last 5\nyears and our time with Python.\n\nWho is your audience?\n\n- The general audience. It should interest all the attendees.\n\nWhat will they get out of it?\n\n- Insight into the use of Python in a Large Experimental Physics\n  Control System.\n\nWhat will you cover?\n\n- Overview (SKA vs MeerKAT vs KAT-7)\n- Why SKA SA chose Python\n- How and where Python is used at SKA SA.\n- Description of the Control and Monitoring problem domain (what we\n  monitor & control, data volumes)\n- Architecture of the CAM subsystem (KATcp, proxies, monitors)\n- Some of the lessons learnt over the last 5 years using Python.\n- Overview of Control interfaces\n- Live demo\n- astronomy images produced by MeerKAT\n",
