  "description": "Machine learning is now widely used in different applications. In some\ncases, it is sufficient to generate batch results using machine learning\nmodels in an offline manner. However, in other cases, models must be\ndeployed online in a production environment, such that end users or\nother system components can benefit from the real-time outputs of these\nmodels. Serving machine learning models involves mostly engineering\nchallenges, including designing the interface, optimizing the time\nrequired to generate predictions and the computing resources required to\nrun the models, etc. In this talk, I will discuss different ways of\nserving machine learning models in Python, and introduce several useful\nPython packages that would make deploying machine learning models much\neasier. I will also share some experience in deploying different kinds\nof machine learning models.\n",
