  "description": "This talk will give an introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning\nin Python. We will cover some of the history of Neural Networks and\nobstacles that were encountered in the 1990s. This will then lead onto\nthe developments in 2006 and 2012 that lead to the resurgence of\ninterest in Neural Networks and the rebranding of the field as Deep\nLearning. These developments will be illustrated by means of an extended\nexample of building a classifier of hand written digits on the MNIST\ndataset. We will start with a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron and then\nbuild this up into a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder. All code will be\ndeveloped using the Keras framework and TensorFlow and can be run on a\nsimple laptop.\n",
