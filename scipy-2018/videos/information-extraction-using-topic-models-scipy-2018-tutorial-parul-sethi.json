  "description": "Topic Modeling is an information retrieval technique to identify topics\nin a large corpus of text documents. This tutorial will guide you\nthrough the process of analyzing your textual data right from\npre-processing raw data - applying topic modeling algorithms -\nevaluating manually and automatically - analyzing using visualizations\nand its applications in few NLP tasks: Discovering topic correlation\n(with dendrograms), Document clustering (demo with Tensorboard),\nDocument analysis (using word coloring). We will also cover the variants\nof topic models like dynamic topic model that learns the evolution of\ntopics in a corpus collected over different time-stamps, and author\ntopic model that learns the topic representations of authors in a\ncorpus.Presenter(s): Speaker: Parul Sethi, University of Delhi\n",
