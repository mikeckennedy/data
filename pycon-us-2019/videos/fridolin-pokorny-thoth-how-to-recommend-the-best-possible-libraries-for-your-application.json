  "description": "Having libraries in your Python project properly locked to a specific\nversion is a well known best practice. Dependency management tools in\nthe Python ecosystem lock dependencies to the latest version available,\nbut what if the latest version available is not the best fit for your\napplication? Open source project Thoth is an advanced Python dependency\nresolver which recommends libraries for your project based on\nobservations that are gathered for Python libraries for specific runtime\nenvironments. How these recommendations look like? How are different\nobservations like performance characteristics of machine learning\nlibraries for a particular hardware gathered?\n",
