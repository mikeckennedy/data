  "description": "Dear 10x programmer. Aren\u2019t you bored of writing code that always works, and\ngives you the exact result you want? Don't lose hope, try a quantum\ncomputer! Regardless of how good your code is (and we\u2019re talking about a\nbrand new programming language), you will never get it fully under control,\nand that's the beauty. Let us show you how mount this untamable quantum\nbeast.\n\nStarting with the basics of a quantum computer (which unfortunately doesn't\nconsist of a bunch of Schrodinger's cats doing computations, either alive or\ndead), we will explain why people think there might be problems where this\nnew evolution of computation will reign supreme in the future, and how we\ncan use it to find good approximate solutions to complex problems in the\nmeantime. We will talk about the new wave of development in quantum hardware\nand software, but the cherry on the cake will be running a computation on\nactual quantum hardware - live.",
