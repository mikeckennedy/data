  "description": "Pickle is a compact serialisation protocol for Python objects. It could\nbe a convenient way for Python programs and distributed systems to\ncommunicate. Unfortunately pickle is widely considered to be unsafe, and\nit has lead to several vulnerabilities over the years. As the Python\nmanual warns\n\n    | The pickle module is not secure against erroneous or\n    | maliciously constructed data. Never unpickle data\n    | received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source.\n\nDoes this have to be the case? Can we use Pickle safely?\n\nThis talk will be a deep dive into what an attacker can do with a\nmaliciously constructed pickles. I\u2019ll show what defences you can\nimplement against the common attacks, especially those that gain\narbitrary code execution. I will present new research into other\nattacks, and mitigations. Finally I will review a few less known\nalternatives to pickle.\n",
