  "description": "Deploying a Python web application can be an involved process. It often requires you to be familiar with systems administration, database administration, networking, security and more. Platform as a service (PaaS) offering, helps reduce this complexity by removing the need to manage the infrastructure on your own, and enables you to focus more on software development. This talk will cover what is needed and how to run a Django application on the popular PaaS, Heroku. It will detail project architectural and configuration changes needed to allow your app to run on Heroku, how to configure external services (such as a database and media file hosting), and the basic commands needed to deploy and manage your site. Throughout this talk, we will use a working codebase to demonstrate.",
