  "description": "Many engineers\u2019 first encounter with a static type-checker is being told off\nby it: you roll your eyes and mypy shouts ERROR. Really, why invest your\nprecious time in mypy at all? This is my conversion story, from disgruntled\nengineer to mypy believer. I\u2019ll share with you the good gospel of its\nbenefits, strategies to increase buy-in from your team and tips for how to\nadd mypy into your workflow.\n\nIn a dynamically typed language like Python, it is worth asking, \u201cWhy use\nmypy and invest precious engineering time to add and check types?\u201d My time\nas an engineer at Nylas has seen an engineering org-wide conversion to mypy,\nfor good reason. I'll share how we were able to gradually increase type\ncoverage in our entire codebase from 0% to 80%.\n\nWarming to the change took effort, but the substantial benefits to the\nquality and sustainability of our codebase have made me into a mypy\nbeliever. Even so, becoming a believer is only the first step. Next, you\nhave to inspire your fellow engineers to join your mypy quest. How can you\nconvince your team to want to put in this extra work? I'll present\nstrategies for expanding buy-in from your fellow engineers and processes to\nensure that your type coverage does not regress. My story may just make\nbelievers out of you and your team.",
