  "description": "What do you think is the most essential skill a data scientist should\nmaster? Knowledge of deep learning tools? Hadoop? SciPy?\n\nThis talk reveals the cornerstone of data science: nothing is as\nimportant as asking data the right questions. To make it work, we need\nsome tools and curiosity.\n\nWhile focusing on tools, we will first go over the data science subject\nas a whole, define our goals, continue with an overview of the essential\nPython packages like Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, and conclude with a\nlive demo. The purpose of this talk is to understand our data: read it,\nvisualize, and formulate right questions, as well as to endorse your\nimagination as a data scientist.\n",
