  "description": "In this short talk, you\u2019ll learn the basics of making a request for\npublic information under both federal and state law, including how to\nwrite the request, who to send it to and tactics for getting\ncompliance.\n\nA healthy democracy depends on open information so that both the\npublic and officials can participate in making good decisions. But a\ngreat deal of information is essentially hidden from public view, held\nin government databases that regular citizens can\u2019t access. Even the\npublic officials who have access are often not fully aware of what\ntheir data might show.\n\nSo how does a developer get access to that information, in hopes of\nshedding light on how government does or does not serve the needs of\ncitizens?",
