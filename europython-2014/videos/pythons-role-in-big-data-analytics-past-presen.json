  "summary": "Python has had a long history in Scientific Computing which means it has\nhad the fundamental building blocks necessary for doing Data Analysis\nfor many years. As a result, Python has long played a role in scientific\nproblems with the largest data sets. Lately, it has also grown in\ntraction as a tool for doing rapid Data Analysis. As a result, Python is\nthe center of an emerging trend that is unifying traditional High\nPerformance Computing with \"Big Data\" applications. In this talk I will\ndiscuss the features of Python and its popular libraries that have\npromoted its use in data analytics. I will also discuss the features\nthat are still missing to enable Python to remain competitive and useful\nfor data scientists and other domain experts. Finally, will describe\nopen source projects that are currently occupying my attention which can\nassist in keeping Python relevant and even essential in Data Analytics\nfor many years to come.\n",
