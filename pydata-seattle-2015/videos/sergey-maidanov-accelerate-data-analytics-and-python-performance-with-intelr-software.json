We'll highlight the new Intel\u00ae Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel\u00ae DAAL), a prototype Python profiler, a Python Distribution for scientific computing & data analysis, Intel\u00ae MKL, Intel\u00ae IPP and the free software tools program.\n\nThis talk presents an overview of some of the tools, technologies and programs being developed and offered by Intel\u00ae for the Data community and Python Developers. The Intel\u00ae Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel\u00ae DAAL) is a C++ and Java software solution for data analytics. The library provides a set of optimized building blocks that can be used in all stages of the data analytics workflow. A prototype Python profiler will be featured, with details on the highlights and advantages of this tool. Another project in the works is a Python Distribution for scientific computing and data analysis, that leverages the power of Intel\u00ae Math Kernel library (Intel\u00ae MKL) to deliver faster performance. A quick spotlight on the latest features and additions to the Intel \u00ae Performance Libraries \u2013 Intel\u00ae MKL and Intel\u00ae Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel\u00ae IPP). And finally, a fresh look at the Intel free tools software program, to discover some of the free offerings for academic researchers, educators, students and open source contributors.",
