  "description": "Daemons are those pieces of software in Unix (including Linux and Mac OS\nX) that run in the background and typically start automatically during\nsystem boot. Times when you might want a daemon include:\n\n-  Monitoring an \"inbox\" directory in situations where a cron job is not\n   appropriate\n-  Managing (possibly multiple) instances of software according to\n   business rules\n\nAlthough most daemons are written in C, Python is a great alternative.\n",
