  "description": "You may have heard the quote \u201cSoftware is eating the world\u201d to\ndescribe how services like Airbnb, Uber, Slack and Skype are\nreplacing the likes of hotels, taxis and the office commute. As\nsoftware engineers, part of our job is accelerating this shift. And\nit\u2019s easy to think that a shift from moving atoms, to moving bits, is\na net win for the planet.\n\nHowever, moving all those bits for our sites around takes servers.\nAnd these servers run on electricity. And most of this electricity\npowering our servers comes from burning fossil fuels. And burning\nthese is a key driver of climate change \u2013 the kind of disruption we\ndon\u2019t want.\n\nSo, what can we do? We\u2019re not going to stop sharing cat pics anytime\nsoon, but we can change how we build online services to make them\ngreener, load faster, and convert better, by borrowing existing\ntechniques from web performance optimisation, containerisation, and\nserverless, as well as good old common sense.\n\nThis talk will show how we can use the tools in the python\ndeveloper's toolbox today for more planet-friendly, sustainable web\ndevelopment, and how this is also good engineering practice.\n\n------\n\nChris Adams started using Django in 2008. Over the past ten years\nhe's worked in startups and agencies, as a sysadmin, product manager,\ndeveloper, and user researcher, and UX consultant, but keeps coming\nback to Python and Django.",
