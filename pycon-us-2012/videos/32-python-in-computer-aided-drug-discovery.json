  "summary": "Computational tools are an integral part of the modern drug-discovery\nprocess. At NIBR, we leverage Python to great success in all stages of\ndrug discovery. Not only can we easily deploy new tools to our\nscientists easily using tools like Django, but Python's approachability\n(that \"fits your brain\" character) allows scientists with no programming\nexperience to start coding themselves!\n",
