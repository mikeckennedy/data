  "description": "The Binder project drastically lowers the bar to sharing and re-using\nsoftware. As a user wanting to try out someone else\u2019s work I only have\nto click a single link. As the author preparing a binder-ready project\nis much easier than having to support many different platforms and for\nmany projects involves little additional work.\n\nIn this talk I will introduce the audience to the concepts and ideas\nbehind the Binder project. I will showcase examples from the community\nto illustrate use-cases and show off the power of Binder.\n\nThree pieces of software power Binder:\n`repo2docker <http://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__,\n`BinderHub <https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ and\n`JupyterHub <http://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__. Using an\nexample repository I will go through the steps required to make a\nrepository binder- ready and what happens when a user launches it. At\neach step I will illustrate the role that each of the three software\ncomponents play and how they interact.\n\nBinder is a project created by its community. I will present pathways\nfor getting involved with the community.\n\nTo wrap up I will highlight plans for future developments and features\nof Binder.\n",
