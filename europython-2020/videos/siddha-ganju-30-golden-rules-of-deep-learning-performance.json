  "description": "\u201cWatching paint dry is faster than training my deep learning model.\u201d\r\n\u201cIf only I had ten more GPUs, I could train my model in time.\u201d\r\n\u201cI want to run my model on a cheap smartphone, but it\u2019s probably too heavy and slow.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like you, then you might like this talk.\r\n\r\nExploring the landscape of training and inference, we cover a myriad of tricks that step-by-step improve the efficiency of most deep learning pipelines, reduce wasted hardware cycles, and make them cost-effective. We identify and fix inefficiencies across different parts of the pipeline, including data preparation, reading and augmentation, training, and inference.\r\n\r\nWith a data-driven approach and easy-to-replicate TensorFlow examples, finely tune the knobs of your deep learning pipeline to get the best out of your hardware. And with the money you save, demand a raise!",
