  "description": "The deep learning hype is real, and the Python ecosystem makes it easier\nthan ever to neural networks to everything from speech recognition to\ngenerating memes. But when picking a model architecture to apply to your\nwork, you should consider more than just state of the art results from\nNeurIPS. The amount of time, money and data available to you are\nequally, if not more, important. This talk will cover some alternatives\nto deep learning, including regression, tree-based methods and distance\nbased methods. More importantly, it will include a frank discussion of\nthe pros and cons of different methods and when it makes sense to use\neach in practice.\n",
