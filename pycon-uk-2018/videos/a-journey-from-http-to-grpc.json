  "description": "motivations, challenges, weapons and achievements\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a collection of happy, but perhaps not so\nefficient, HTTP micro-services that was being developed as part of a\nmajor recommendation platform.\n\nDuring a snowy spring morning, their retirement was decreed. A new\ngeneration of gRPC micro-services was to replace them.\n\nWith the support of some brave pathfinders and a few sacrifices, the\ngRPC micro-services finally reached their destination.\n\nAnd they lived happily ever after.\n\nThis story is based on real facts. The pathfinders were data scientists\nand engineers, the date is early 2018 and the location is BBC, UK.",
