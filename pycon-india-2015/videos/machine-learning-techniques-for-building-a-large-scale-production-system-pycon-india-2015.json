  "description": "Speaker: Arthi Venkataraman\n\nThis presentation is about how to build a scalable prediction system for near real time use using Python. A user will enter his / her requirements using Natural language. The system will do a natural language processing of the input text. Machine learning models will be used to predict the needed fields. This solution can be used for different use cases including agent allocations for Incident work bench , Recommendation services , etc.\n\nDetails: https://in.pycon.org/cfp/pycon-india-2015/proposals/building-a-large-scale-production-ready-prediction-system-using-python/",
