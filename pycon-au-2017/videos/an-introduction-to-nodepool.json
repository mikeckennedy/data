  "description": "Nodepool is a system for launching single-use test nodes (VM's) on demand based on images built with cached data. It is designed to work with any OpenStack based cloud, and is part of a suite of tools that form a comprehensive test system including Jenkins and Zuul.\n\nNodepool works across multiple clouds and scales to launching and managing thousands of nodes per an hour.\n\nThis talk is an introduction on how to deploy and use nodepool for CI. Given time we may also touch on how it may be used to manage nodes for workloads other than just testing.",
