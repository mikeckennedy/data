  "description": "Bayesian statistical methods are becoming more common, but there are not many resources to help beginners get started. People who know Python can use their programming skills to get a head start. In this tutorial, I introduce Bayesian methods using grid algorithms, which help develop understanding, and MCMC, which is a powerful algorithm for real-world problems.",
