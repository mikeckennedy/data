  "description": "At some point every Python programmer sees Python bytecode files -- they're those '.pyc' files Python likes to leave behind after it runs. But have you ever wondered what's really going on in those files? Well, wonder no more! In this talk you'll learn what Python bytecode is and how it's used to execute your code, as well as how to decipher and read it, and how to reason about bytecode to understand the performance of your Python code.",
