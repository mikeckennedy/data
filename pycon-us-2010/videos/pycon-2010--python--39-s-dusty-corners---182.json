  "description": "Python's Dusty Corners\n\nPresented by Jack Diederich\n\nThe talk will be a brief overview of all the features in python that you\ndon't need to know about right up until the moment you do. The list\nincludes how comparisons work, descriptors, iterators, context managers,\nnamespaces, else clauses on for/while loops (suggested by Hettinger).\nThe narrative of the talk is that these are features that you don't need\nand/or shouldn't use in your day-to-day code but that you need to keep\nin the back of your mind because other people's code and the stdlib do\nuse them. As Alex Martelli pointed out in his wonderful talk\n\"Abstractions as Leverage\" you can't successfully function at one level\nof abstraction if you don't know what is going on at the next level\ndown. This talk is a whirlwind tour of the next level down.\n",
