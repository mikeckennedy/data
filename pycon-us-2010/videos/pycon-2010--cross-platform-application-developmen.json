  "description": "Cross platform application development and distribution\n\nPresented by Stani Michiels and Nadia Alramli\n\nYou think Python gives you native cross platform applications for free?\nThink twice. Are you interested in distributing your application to\nother platforms but not sure how?\n\nWe will give tips and examples on how to enhance the native feel of your\napplication: notifications, registration of file types and more. The\ntalk will also help you to avoid common pitfalls and provides solutions\nfor designing cross platform user interfaces. (Although we use wxPython\nas an example, the principles are valid for other toolkits as well.)\nWe'll show you where to start if you want to distribute your application\nto different platforms, briefly discussing tools like py2exe, py2app and\nDebian/Ubuntu packaging ecosystem. This talk is based on our experience\nfrom developing Phatch (Photo Batch Processor) and SPE (Python Editor).\n",
