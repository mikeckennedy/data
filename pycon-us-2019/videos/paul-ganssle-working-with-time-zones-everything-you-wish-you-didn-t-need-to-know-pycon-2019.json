  "description": "Time zones are complicated, but they are a fact of engineering life.\nTime zones have `skipped entire\ndays <http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16351377>`__ and repeated\nothers. There are time zones that switch to `DST twice per\nyear <https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/morocco/casablanca>`__. But\nnot necessarily every year. In Python it's even possible to create\ndatetimes with non-transitive equality (``a == b``, ``b == c``,\n``a != c``).\n\nIn this talk you'll learn about Python's time zone model and other\nconcepts critical to avoiding datetime troubles. Using ``dateutil`` and\n``pytz`` as examples, this talk covers how to deal with ambiguous and\nimaginary times, datetime arithmetic around a Daylight Savings Time\ntransition, and datetime's new ``fold`` attribute, introduced in Python\n3.6 (`PEP 495 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0495/>`__).\n",
