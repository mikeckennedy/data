  "description": "1 year after releasing MJML (https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml), it\u2019s time\nto stand back and look at the lessons we learnt. We\u2019ll discuss about how\nto get involved into open source, why you would, and how to remain\ncredible as a company doing open source. We\u2019ll also go over one of the\nmost important things in open source: community. How to get people\ninvolved, how to communicate and collaborate effectively, but also how\nto work with people you might not be best friends with.\n",
