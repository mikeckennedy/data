  "description": "This talk is about people, not tools. It takes you on a journey from building software to building a community.\n\nPython communities are special in many ways, from non-commercial nature to viral enthusiasm and friendliness. This talk shares one recipe of growing such community, covering hands-on experience, insider details and financial challenges.\n\nThe recipe is based on the story how one year ago a tempting idea of making Python meetups in Munich was converted into PyCon.DE. No companies, no funds, no business network. Just Python community, and some enthusiasm.",
