  "summary": "Can your robot play Angry Birds? On an iPhone? Mine can. I call it\n\"BitbeamBot\". It started as an art project, but it has a much more\nserious practical application: mobile web testing. To trust that your\nmobile app truly works, you need an end-to-end test on the actual\ndevice. BitbeamBot is an Arduino-powered open-source hardware CNC robot\nthat can test any application on any mobile device.\n",
