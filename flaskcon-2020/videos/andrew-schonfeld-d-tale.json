  "description": "Full-stack web developer for the last 15 years (of which 7 using Flask), Andrew talks about D-Tale (https://github.com/man-group/dtale\u200b) an OS project which gives users the ability to visualise most Pandas data structures from python console, Jupyter notebook or CLI. It does so by spinning up a small Flask process with minimal jinja templating, Plotly Dash, and a custom React front-end. It can demo the vast functionality available, all the different ways you can access it and dive deeper into how Flask really anchors the whole thing.",
