  "description": "#9 PyData Warsaw\n\nWith Presto, an open source distributed analytical SQL engine, it is possible to query different kinds of data sources via an uniform ANSI SQL interface. Presto uses connector architecture that provides an abstraction layer for anything that can be expressed in a row-like format, ranging from MySQL tables, HDFS, Amazon S3 to NoSQL stores, Kafka streams and proprietary data sources. Presto allows anyone to implement a connector and benefit from the capabilities of the Presto SQL engine, enabling them to join data from various sources within a single SQL query. We will additionally show you how to leverage Presto in an analytical, Python based pipeline.",
