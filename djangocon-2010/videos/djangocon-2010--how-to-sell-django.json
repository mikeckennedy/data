  "description": "It seems that a lot of people want to use Django (and Python), but their\ncustomer, management, or organization won't let them. Django is a great\ntool, but it can be challenging to get in the door. This panel will\nexplore how companies and individuals have successfully introduced\nDjango, what tools are available to sell Django, and what pitfalls there\nare to avoid.\n\nPossible questions will include:\n\n-  What is a good example success story you can share?\n-  How do you deal with organizations that have already spent\n   bucketloads of money on a piss-poor technology stack, are hurting for\n   it, but can't seem to let go?\n-  How do you fight Fear-Uncertainty-Doubt (FUD) spread by people who\n   stand to lose from introducing Django?\n-  What tools are available to help sell Django?\n\n`shmpe <http://shmpe.com/>`__\n",
