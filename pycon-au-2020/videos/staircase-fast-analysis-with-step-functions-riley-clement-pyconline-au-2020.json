  "description": "Riley Clement\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/3TDS8K\n\nThis talk introduces the Staircase package \u2013 a new open source package with applications in data analysis.  It aims to take the audience on a journey from basics to more advanced usage at a comfortable pace.   A tutorial-esque style will be used to introduce fundamentals, followed by four examples abstracted from real world use cases.\r\n\r\nIf you work with timestamped data and enjoy a little bit of math, mixed with a terrible sense of humour, then this talk could be right up your alley.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 10:25:00 2020 at Obvious",
