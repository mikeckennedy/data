  "description": "It seems like everyone is talking about GIS lately, but what exactly is\nit, anyway? And more importantly: as a Python user, why should you care?\n\nThis talk's goal is twofold: first, to try and demystify the basic idea\nof \"GIS\" for people who are interested in the topic and are coming from\na Python background. I'll cover general GIS concepts, talk about spatial\ndata, and what makes it unique. Second, to show how you might be able to\nuse and integrate GIS into your work. I'll go over some of the more\ncommon Python tools available for working with GIS data, and show\nexamples of use-cases. Although I'll briefly touch on major GIS industry\nplayers, my main focus will be on easily-accessible, free & open source\ntools.\n\nThis is an all-levels talk: like the title says, this is for \"Python\nPeople\"! Whether you consider yourself a seasoned Python developer, an\nenthusiastic fan, or are just getting started: you should be able to\nlearn something new while following along with the concepts & examples\nI'll discuss.\n",
