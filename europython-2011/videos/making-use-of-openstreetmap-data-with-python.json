  "description": "Ever wondered how web maps are created? Ever wondered if you could build\nsomething like Google Maps over a weekend? You probably can't, but this\ntalk will show you the basics of what you need to know, such as\nimporting data, rendering maps and even building simple routes. And all\nof this in Python!\n\nAbstract: \\* Learning how OSM data looks \\* Parsing and importing the\ndata * Rendering maps with Mapnik * Bits of code required to build\ngeocoder * Building simple router with Python and PostGIS * And anything\nelse I forgot to mention in this abstract but will talk about\n\nDefinitions: OpenStreetMap - the so-called \"Wikipedia of maps\" project,\nwith thousands of contributors who edit the map data of the whole world.\nUnlike similar projects, the map data is completely free (both as in\nbeer and as in speech) and thus anyone can make use of it. Mapnik -\nrendering framework, created specifically for OpenStreetMap, written in\nC++ and Python. PostGIS - an extension of PostgreSQL database, with\nsupport for many useful GIS features.\n",
