  "description": "This is a continuation of a series called Tales from the Ops Side. Back in November 2016, a seemingly innocuous piece of code that has been running for years starts throwing a very strange and nonsensical exception. This strange exception seemed to be thrown completely at random, could not be reproduced in any other environment, and would also self-heal! This talk tells the story of a baffling bug hunt spread over many weeks, involved all members of the company, including the CEO and CTO, and lead us deep into the guts of CPython and countless dead-ends.",
