  "description": "Gevent is an ultra-fast networking library built on top of the greenlet\nmodule. Greenlets are the ideal solution to making Django's synchronous\nAPI calls possible in a cooperative concurrency environment.\n\nI'll begin with an overview of the models of network programming,\nincluding threading, callbacks, and coroutines. I'll explain how\ngreenlets (coroutines) work in harmony to provide simple blocking\nnetwork APIs while not blocking execution of the entire thread. I'll\nshow how easy it is to integrate other network services into your app.\n\nAs an exploration into using realtime features in Django, I'll\ndemonstrate a simple realtime collaboration app that uses websockets for\ncommunication. I will show how to integrate ZeroMQ to allow the app to\nscale beyond a single server. I will also show how to attach to and\nmonitor your web app using gevent.backdoor.\n",

Django's synchronous APIs\nmake it impractical to use in a callback-based networking library, but\nfast single-threaded concurrency is still possible using the\nmind-blowing capabilities of coroutines.\n",
