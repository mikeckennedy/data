  "description": "Open Source projects always lack contributors. At the PyCon Munich I presented 10 actionable steps to grow a community, based on what we did to grow coala from ~5 contributors to over 300 people having submitted a patch successfully without lowering our quality bar. The feedback on this talk has been overwhelming and it's time to launch the next iteration:\n\n\"Open Source Contributor Automation\" will give you a short overview over the strategies to grow an open source project like a startup. We will then learn about tools and strategies to save maintainers from burning out on newcomers: you will learn about our open source tooling and how to use it on your organization.",
