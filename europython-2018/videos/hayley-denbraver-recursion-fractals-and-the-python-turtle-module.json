  "description": "To understand recursion you must first understand recursion.\nAlternatively, you could come to a talk that will demonstrate the basics\nof recursion, using fractals drawn by the python turtle module!\n\nWhat are fractals? Fractals are psychedelic designs that appear\nbasically the same regardless of scale. They also appear all over\nnature\u2013consider how a tree trunk and branches is similar in structure to\nbranches and twigs or how a wave is made of mini waves. Best of all,\nfractals can be constructed using recursive functions.\n\nWhat is the turtle module? It is part of the standard python library\nthat can be used to draw amazing things and is commonly used as a tool\nfor learning to code.\n\nCome for the recursion, stay for the amazing fractals, and leave knowing\nthat no turtles were harmed in the making of this talk.\n\nThis talk is suitable for all python enthusiasts. Those who love\nmathematics will love this talk. Advanced developers will learn more\nabout a tool that can be used to teach people to code. There is\nsomething for everyone.\n",
