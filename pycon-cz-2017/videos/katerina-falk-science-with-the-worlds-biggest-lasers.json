  "description": "Laser is possibly the most important invention of the 20th century\nwith applications spanning across all human activities from medicine,\ntelecommunications, information technology or entertainment to\nmanufacturing, defense, energy production or fundamental science\nresearch in astrophysics or cosmology.\n\nThis talk will give you a brief overview of how lasers work, their\napplications and future developments. It will also provide a tour of\nthe world\u2019s biggest laser facilities and the new laser center ELI\nBeamlines currently constructed on the outskirts of Prague that will\nsoon harbor the most powerful laser beam in the world. A brief\noutline of the most recent research in particle acceleration and\nultra-fast x-ray and particle diagnostics by Katerina Falk will also\nbe given.\n\n------\n\nKate\u0159ina works as a scientist specializing in plasma physics with a\nspecial focus dense plasmas relevant to fusion technology and\nlaboratory astrophysics. She earned her degrees at Imperial College\nLondon and the University of Oxford, before moving to New Mexico,\nUSA, where she joined a research group at Los Alamos National\nLaboratory. She has worked on the biggest laser systems on the planet\nbefore joining the scientific team at ELI Beamlines, Czech Academy of\nSciences.",
