  "description": "As publicly announced in early 2018, Daimler AG has started cooperations\nwith IBM and Google on Quantum Computing. When doing concrete\nexperiments with the Quantum Computing cloud based offerings, two\ndifferent Python libraries provided by IBM and Google are used. They are\nnamed QISKIT in the case of IBM and CIRQ in the case of Google. The\nexperiments with both libraries are handled using appropriate Jupyter\nNotebooks. This talk gives a brief introduction on Quantum Computing,\nspecifically on Quantum Computers based on transmon-based QBits. This is\nfollowed by an introduction of the both Python libraries that are used.\nThen some details about the Jupyter notebooks that are used are given.\nThe talk will finish with some demos and an overview about the most\nimportant practical experiences with both Quantum Computing offerings.\n",
