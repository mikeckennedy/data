  "description": "A Configuration Comparison in Python\n\nPresented at PyCon 2009 by Terry Peppers\n\nWhen faced with the simple task of figuring out how to use configuration\nto your advantage in Python there are a myriad of methods. The purpose\nof this talk is to walk through the standard library modules and the\npopular Python Package Index modules comparing and contrasting\nconfiguration formats and the code that consumes them. Specifically, I\nwould like to walk through the use of the csv module, the ConfigParser\nmodule, ConfigObj, lxml, PyYaml and SimpleJSON.\n",
