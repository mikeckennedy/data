By using datasets that contain different plays we can obtain different game experiences or models that can adapt to the style of a player.\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2019 conference.\nhttps://pycon.de\n\nMore details at the conference page: https://de.pycon.org/program/VCSBUY\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pyconde",
