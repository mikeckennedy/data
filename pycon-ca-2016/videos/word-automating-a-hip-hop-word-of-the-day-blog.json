  "description": "Have you ever been surprised by sophisticated vocabulary used by some\nhip-hop artists? With standard data science tools, I search a large\ncorpus of hip-hop lyrics in order to extract rhyming couplets that\ninclude uncommon and interesting words. Using curated output from this\ncode, I demonstrate how to automate the creation of short text-based\nposts for a hip-hop themed \"Word of the Day\" blog.\n\nChristopher Ing Bio\n-------------------\n\nChris is a PhD student at University of Toronto studying computational\nbiochemistry. He has degrees in computational physics and physics from\nUniversity of Waterloo. He has converted countless graduate students to\nPython in the wake of his scientific career, not to mention, he's a\nminor celebrity on Tumblr.\n",
