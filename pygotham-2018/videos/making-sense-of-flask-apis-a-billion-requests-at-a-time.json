  "description": "You\u2019ve got a Flask, Django, or other API. How are people using it? Is anything going wrong? How does it perform? These questions become increasingly hard to answer once manually ``tail``\u2019ing your log files becomes impractical.\n\nThis talk will describe how to effectively answer these questions. I\u2019ll demonstrate a suite of tools we use to quickly visualize insights across dozens of API endpoints and billions of requests. I\u2019ll show logging techniques to more consistently store, organize, and process the right data to make sense of it all. I\u2019ll talk about the processes we\u2019ve put in place to routinely revisit these questions and quickly alert when things go awry. Finally, despite all the pretty graphs I\u2019ll show you, I\u2019ll discuss how at the end of the day it is the team and cultural aspects that keep any API in line and growing.\n\nThese stories, best practices, and advice come from my experience building and scaling the Nylas APIs. Our APIs allow developers to GET, POST and PUT email threads, calendar events, contacts, and any other item you\u2019d find in an Exchange, GSuite, or IMAP mailbox. Hundreds of thousands of mailboxes later, and over a hundred million requests a day, making sense of what\u2019s going on in the system at any given time present challenges I\u2019m excited to share.",
