This is great news for users, but also means that developers of higher-level or domain-specific tools can build upon it with confidence.\n\nThis talk will briefly discuss some of the history of the project leading up to the present, including lessons learned about OSS development. After this quick status update, I will discuss and demonstrate two tools that are already building on and integrating with Bokeh:\n\n* Datashader is a sophisticated Python rendering pipeline that can be used together with Bokeh to effectively visualize large (billion+ point) data sets quickly.\n\n* Holoviews is a very high level data language for slicing and dicing datasets that can automatically build interactive visualizations using Bokeh, based on the structure of your data.",
