  "description": "The Reference Model for Disease progression is a league of disease\nmodels that determines fitness of publicly available populations and\nmodels and assumptions. The Reference Model has grown to the point that\nit was hard to maintain the code base and increase the number of\npopulations. Recent advances with the MIcro Simulation Tool (MIST), that\nruns the model, allow object oriented population generation.\nEvolutionary Computation, using the Python Inspyred library by Aaron\nGarrett, is a key element in MIST population generation. Recent\ndevelopments allow easier introductions of variations in population\ngeneration to figure out fitness of unknown base assumptions. This is\npowerful in conjunction with High Performance Computing that allows\ntesting multiple modeling assumptions in parallel.\n\nPrevious work was presented in this and other venues:\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyvxiljc5vA \n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD896WakR94\n\n",
