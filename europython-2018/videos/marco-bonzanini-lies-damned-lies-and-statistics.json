  "description": "Statistics show that eating ice cream causes death by drowning.\n\nIf this sounds baffling, this talk will help you to understand\ncorrelation, bias, statistical significance and other statistical\ntechniques that are commonly (mis)used to support an argument that\nleads, by accident or on purpose, to drawing the wrong conclusions.\n\nThe casual observer is exposed to the use of statistics and probability\nin everyday life, but it is extremely easy to fall victim of a\nstatistical fallacy, even for professional users.\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to help the audience understand how to\nrecognise and avoid these fallacies, by combining an introduction to\nstatistics with examples of lies and damned lies, in a way that is\napproachable for beginners.\n\nAgenda:\n\n-  Correlation and causation\n-  Simpson\u2019s Paradox\n-  Sampling bias\n-  Data visualisation gone wild\n-  Statistical significance (and Data dredging a.k.a. p-hacking)\n",
