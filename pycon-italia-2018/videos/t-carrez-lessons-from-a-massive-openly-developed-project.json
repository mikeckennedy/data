  "description": "OpenStack is a massive open source project, formed of multiple\ncomponents written in Python. Created in 2010, it attracted thousands of\ndevelopers which produced hundreds of thousands of commits. It is\ncompletely openly-developed: there is no single organization owning it,\nand anyone can participate on a level playing ground.\n\nDuring this wild ride, we discovered new classes of issues, crafted\nnovel solutions, made mistakes and learned lessons, most of them\napplicable to other open source projects. Come learn about software\nengineering best practices, open collaboration advice and other fun tips\nand tricks based on our experience ! No prior experience with OpenStack\nis needed to attend this talk.\n\nin \\_\\_on **sabato 21 aprile** at 14:45 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
