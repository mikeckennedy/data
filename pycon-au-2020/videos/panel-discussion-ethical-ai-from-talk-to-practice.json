Issues that have been called out in particular are: data privacy, the harm that algorithmic bias can have, and the negative repercussions of unchecked recommendation systems blindly maximising engagement.\r\n\r\nThat ethical AI has become part of the discourse of data and AI is a positive sign, but how do we move from just talk? Who is responsible? What can you do about these issues?\r\n\r\nIn this moderated panel, we'll hear from three experienced data science practitioners on how these issues play out in their professional lives, as well as their perspectives on how we can actively work towards more ethical AI. \r\n\r\nWe hope this discussion will provide a valuable backdrop upon which to reflect throughout the rest of the day as we cover a range of exciting topics in science, data, and analytics.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 09:15:00 2020 at Curlyboi",
