  "description": "Any growing startup will at some point face the problem of making their product work fast enough to provide a good user experience. At Desti, we had to get our search from taking multiple seconds to an average of 300ms. To achieve that goal, we developed a tool and methodology for measurement, and employed multiple techniques of optimization. We improved our architecture, system design, and implementation before reaching that goal. In this talk, I\u2019ll share our measurement tool and methodology, and the optimization techniques we used.\n\nSlides available here: http://il.pycon.org/2016/static/sessions/imri-goldberg.pdf",
