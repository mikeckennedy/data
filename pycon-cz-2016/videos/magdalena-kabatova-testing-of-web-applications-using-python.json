  "description": "In the continuous integration development process, automatic testing\nis critical. The application must be delivered properly to customers\nand users. And with frequent releases, manual testing is exhausting.\n\nTherefore developers need integration and system tests, aside from\nbasic unit tests - to make sure their commits are integrated properly\nand did not break anything. No more: one hotfix creates two new bugs!\n\nFor beginners: I will give a brief introduction to software testing\nand its types and talk about how easy is to start with writing\nautomatic tests in Python.\n\nFor advanced: I will present integration testing of Cleerio web\nmapping application (originally written in JavaScript and PHP) using\nPython together with Selenium project.",
