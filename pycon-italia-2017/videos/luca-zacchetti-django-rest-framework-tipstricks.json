  "description": "Developing Web APIs for Django websites have never been so easy.\nStarting from a real world use case, I\u2019ll explain why DRF became our\nweapon of choice to develop in a fast and easy way all the APIs we need\nat Cloud Academy.\n\nWe\u2019ll start talking about the main benefits that DRF brings to Django\nprojects, then we\u2019ll use our real world use case to describe the best\npractices we use to build fast, secure and maintainable APIs diving into\nDRF main features and functionalities.\n\nThe scope of this talk is to explain in a very practical way how DRF can\nbe integrated into Django projects to build beautiful web APIs. We\u2019ll\nuse a lot of code examples and performance benchmarks to describe the\nvarious features explored during the talk. No prior experience on DRF is\nrequired but at least some basic knowledge of Django is suggested for\nattendees.\n",
