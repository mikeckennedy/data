  "description": "It seems that every week there is a news story that prompts software\ndevelopers to think about the ethical implications of their work. As\nindividuals, teams, and communities we need to consider the impact of\nthe code we write. But what about code that we are using, but did not\ncreate?\n\nHow does Open Source Software factor into this equation? OSS is used\nacross the industry, but is written and maintained primarily by\nvolunteers. What are best practices for maintainers, contributors,\nindividual users, and companies who incorporate open source into their\nwork? How can we protect ourselves and our users, while still benefiting\nfrom the innovation and collaboration of open source software?\n",
