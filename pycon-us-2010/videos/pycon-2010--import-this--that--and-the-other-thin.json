  "description": "Import this, that, and the other thing. Custom importers\n\nPresented by Brett Cannon\n\nSince Python 2.3, the ability has existed to customize the import\nprocess so that one can support code stored in alternative formats, e.g.\nzipimport and its support of importing code from a zip file. The aim of\nthis talk is to make sure you understand how the custom import mechanism\nworks and how to write your own custom importers using importlib from\nPython 3.1.\n",
