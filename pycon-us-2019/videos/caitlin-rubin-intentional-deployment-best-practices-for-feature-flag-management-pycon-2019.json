  "description": "Feature flags can be powerful tools in mitigating risk in your\ndevelopment cycle \u2014 *if you use them correctly*. Failing to do so can\nhave enormous consequences for yourself and your business. In 2012 one\nimproperly deployed feature flag sent a $365 million company into\nbankruptcy in 45 minutes. So let\u2019s talk about feature flags,\nspecifically in how they can help us with intentional deployment.\nFeature flags give us a high degree of control over the features we\nrelease \u2014 but what ensures we have a high degree of control over our\nfeature flags?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this talk, I\u2019ll go over the best practices which will make your\nfeature flagging program a success. The humble Feature Flag can\ntransform into many different things: release toggle, experiment, kill\nswitch, permissioning and more. I\u2019ll talk briefly about the\npossibilities Feature Flags open up, and then describe how to use best\npractices of visibility and accountability to align those different\nflags into a cohesive feature flagging system.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After this talk, you\u2019ll know what best practices make a successful\nfeature flagging program, and be able to implement them into your\ncurrent solution to deploy faster and with less risk.\n",
