  "description": "Transition is remarkably like monkey patching a very complex legacy system: From changing identifiers to modifying our behavior, to interacting with interfaces that aren't quite sure how to deal with the modifications.\n\nThis talk will cover my experiences transitioning quite publicly in the New York City area Python community and how those interactions can inform how we design systems: both social and software.",
