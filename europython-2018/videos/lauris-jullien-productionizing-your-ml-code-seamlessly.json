  "description": "Data science and Machine Learning are hot topics right now for Software\nEngineers and beyond. And there are a lot of python tools that allow you\nto hack together a notebook to quickly get insight on your data, or\ntrain a model to predict, or classify. Or you might have inherited some\ndata wrangling and modeling {Jupyter/Zeppelin} notebook code from\nsomeone else, like the resident data scientist.\n\nThe code works on test data, when you run the cells in the right order\n(skipping cell 22), and you believe that the insight gained from this\nwork would be a valuable game changer. But now how do you take this\nexperimental code into production, and keep it up-to-date with a regular\nretraining schedule? And what do you need to do after that, to ensure\nthat it remains reliable and brings value in the long term?\n\nThese will be the questions this talk will answer, focusing on 2 main\nthemes: 1. What does running an ML model in production involve? 2. How\nto improve your development workflow to make the path to production\neasier?\n\nThis talk will draw examples from real projects at Yelp, like migrating\na pandas/sklearn classification project into production with pyspark,\nwhile aiming to give advice that is not dependent on specific\nframeworks, or tools, and is useful for listeners from all backgrounds.\n",
