  "description": "Python is very well known for its ecosystem of mature scientific\ncomputing packages. They range from low-level providers of generic\nfunctionality like NumPy to very domain specific tools like\nscikit-learn. A few years back, machine learning frameworks could be\neasily classified into the second category, but this is changing now.\nThey become increasingly powerful and start to be applied in a whole\nvariety of settings different than their original purpose. In this talk,\nI\u2019ll present a basic tour of PyTorch, a relatively new library that has\nalready gathered a significant user base. I\u2019ll describe features useful\nboth in machine learning and other domains, explain how it fits into the\nPython landscape, and showcase scenarios where it provides benefits over\nexisting tools.\n\nin \\_\\_on **domenica 22 aprile** at 09:45 `**See\nschedule** </p3/schedule/pycon9/>`__\n",
