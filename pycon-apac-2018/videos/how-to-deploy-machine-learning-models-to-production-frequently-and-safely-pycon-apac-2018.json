  "description": "ML practitioners can have a hard time deploying their models to\nproduction, even though continuous & fear-free deployments is a solved\nproblem in software engineering. We will demonstrate how we can apply\n\"continuous delivery\" principles to reduce deployment time from\nweeks/months into <30-minutes\n",
