  "summary": "The IPython Notebook is a powerful web app for exploring ideas and data\nsets with Python. It has excellent integration with Matplotlib, giving\nthe user highly customisable static plots with ease. But for larger data\nsets, a static plot may not be ideal - the ability to pan, zoom, choose\ndynamic layers and sample the data at particular points would be nice.\nThis talk will demonstrate just how easy it is to integrate a Web Map\nService/client such as Pydap/Leaflet.js into the IPython Notebook.\n",
