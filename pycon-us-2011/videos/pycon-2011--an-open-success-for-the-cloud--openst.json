  "description": "An Open success for the cloud: OpenStack\n\nPresented by Andy Smith\n\nOpenStack is a collection of open source technologies written entirely\nin Python, delivering a massively scalable cloud operating system.\nOpenStack is currently developing two interrelated projects: OpenStack\nCompute and OpenStack Object Storage. OpenStack Compute is software to\nprovision and manage large groups of virtual private servers, and\nOpenStack Object Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable\nobject storage using clusters of commodity servers to store terabytes or\neven petabytes of data.\n\nThis talk will go into details about the success of OpenStack with\nPython, limitations and how overall, Python was the right technology\nchoice.\n",
