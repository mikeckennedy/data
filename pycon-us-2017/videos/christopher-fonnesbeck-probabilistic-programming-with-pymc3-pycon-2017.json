  "description": "Bayesian statistics offers robust and flexible methods for data analysis\nthat, because they are based on probability models, have the added\nbenefit of being readily interpretable by non-statisticians. Until\nrecently, however, the implementation of Bayesian models has been\nprohibitively complex for use by most analysts. But, the advent of\nprobabilistic programming has served to abstract the complexity of\nBayesian statistics, making such methods more broadly available. PyMC3\nis a open-source Python module for probabilistic programming that\nimplements several modern, computationally-intensive statistical\nalgorithms for fitting Bayesian models, including Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo (HMC) and variational inference. PyMC3\u2019s intuitive syntax is\nhelpful for new users, and the reliance on Theano for much of the\ncomputational work has allowed developers to keep the code base simple,\nmaking it easy to extend the software to meet analytic needs. PyMC3\nitself extends Python's powerful \"scientific stack\" of development\ntools, which provide fast and efficient data structures, parallel\nprocessing, and interfaces for describing statistical models.\n",
