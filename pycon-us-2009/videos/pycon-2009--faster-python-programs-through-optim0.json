  "description": "[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: vga blurry] Although Python programs may be slow for\ncertain types of tasks, there are many different ways to improve\nperformance. This tutorial will introduce optimization strategies and\ndemonstrate techniques to implement them. Another of the objectives of\nthis course is to give participants the ability to decide what might be\nthe optimal solution for a certain performance problem. Participants are\nstrongly recommended to bring laptops because all techniques are\nintroduced with examples and exercises.\n",
