  "description": "These days it is difficult for software to meet users\u2019 expectations to\nbehave intelligently. When a program displays a lack of even the most\nbasic awareness of context it is jarring. At the same time organisations\nare seeking to gain a competitive advantage through software that\nbehaves adaptively based on the information at hand. Solving these\nproblems is a challenge for today\u2019s developers. There is general\nagreement among seasoned developers that having a good understanding of\nbasic computer science data structures and algorithms is essential. That\nsaid there is one sub-section of algorithms that is underused by most\ndevelopers, the algorithms that fall under the general rubric of\nArtificial Intelligence. This talk aims to remedy that by providing a\nquick refresher course on basic AI algorithms using Python. This talk is\nnot about building thinking machines, but rather about creating software\nthat users won\u2019t think is stupid. Basic AI techniques such as Constraint\nPropagation and Identification Trees, can really help developers along\nthe road to smarter software.\n",
