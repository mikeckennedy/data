  "description": "Bloscpack [1] is a reference implementation and file-format for fast\nserialization of numerical data. It features lightweight, chunked and\ncompressed storage, based on the extremely fast Blosc [2] metacodec and\nsupports serialization of Numpy arrays out-of-the-box. Recently, Blosc\n-- being the metacodec that it is -- has received support for using the\npopular and widely used Snappy [3], LZ4 [4], and ZLib [5] codecs, and\nso, now Bloscpack supports serializing Numpy arrays easily with those\ncodecs! In this talk I will present recent benchmarks of Bloscpack\nperformance on a variety of artificial and real-world datasets with a\nspecial focus on the newly available codecs. In these benchmarks I will\ncompare Bloscpack, both performance and usability wise, to alternatives\nsuch as Numpy's native offerings (NPZ and NPY), HDF5/PyTables [6], and\nif time permits, to novel bleeding edge solutions. Lastly I will argue\nthat compressed and chunked storage format such as Bloscpack can be and\nsomewhat already is a useful substrate on which to build more powerful\napplications such as online analytical processing engines and\ndistributed computing frameworks.
