  "description": "Are you a woman wanting to break into the engineering field? Or do you\nknow any women wanting to learn how to code, but don\u2019t know how to help\nthem? Perhaps our nerdy ladies are a bit shy to ask for help. That\u2019s\nokay! I\u2019ll give you some tools to nudge you in the right direction. In\nthis session, I\u00e2??ll be talking about how I increased women\u00e2??s\nengagement in the Python community though demonstrating how versatile\nthe language is with practical projects, by creating a safe space for\nwomen to learn and to fail, and by encouraging involvement beyond the\nclassroom.\n",
