  "description": "Development environments can become cumbersome over time, with setup\noccasionally filling multiple pages of documentation and making\nonboarding new team members a difficult task. Whether you deploy your\nPython application using containers or not, Docker Compose is a great\ntool for defining development environments that closely mirror\nproduction and can be spun up with a single command.\n\nBy the end of this talk, audience members will understand the following\nconcepts:\n\n-  Running application services/dependencies inside containers and its\n   advantages and disadvantages.\n-  Defining application environment and services via Dockerfile,\n   docker-compose.yml configuration files.\n-  Managing the environment using the ``docker-compose`` CLI.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, a Django application will be configured to\nuse a database, a cache, a queue and task worker.\n",
