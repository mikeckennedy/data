  "description": "Speaker: Thorben Jensen\n\nTrack:PyData\nFeature engineering is crucial for supervised learning (SL), but labor-intensive. Automating this task is less established, compared to other steps of SL. We therefore present and compare approached and open-source libraries for automating this task.\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2019 conference.\nhttps://pycon.de\n\nMore details at the conference page: https://de.pycon.org/program/7EEPKX\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pyconde",
