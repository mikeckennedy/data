Enstaller (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Enstaller/4.0.0) is\na tool I wrote for installing egg-based packages, which are not\nnecessarily Python packages, such as SWIG or HDF5. I will discuss the\narchitecture of Enstaller, and in particular the egg-based distribution\nformat.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Frezz frame in the start of the video]\n",
