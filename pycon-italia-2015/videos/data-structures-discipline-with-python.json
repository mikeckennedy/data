  "description": "Data Structures is traditionally a \u201cbogeyman\u201d discipline in Computer\nScience courses and has a high degree of failure. In FATEC S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos\nCampos we are adopting a hybrid approach, with C and Python languages.\nThe failure rate decreased from 85% (2008) to 12% (2014). The talk will\nbe extensively illustrated with code in C and Python, addressing the\nvarious concepts taught in this course.\n",
