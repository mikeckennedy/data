  "description": "As a lawyer and free software enthusiast with a life-critical medical\ndevice implanted in their body, Karen Sandler has come to understand how the\ncritical choices we are making about software will have huge societal\nimpact. In the age of corporate surveillance and walled-garden platforms,\nwhere every week there is a new known software vulnerability, software\nfreedom is more important than ever.\n\nKaren will touch on potential avenues for accountability, transparency, and\naccess to remedies as we hurtle towards an Internet of Things built on\nproprietary source code that prevents us from knowing exactly how these\nvital devices work, what data they are collecting and to what ends, what\ntheir vulnerabilities might be, and the extent to which their closed,\nproprietary nature keeps us from developing societal mechanisms and review\nprocesses to keep us safe.",
