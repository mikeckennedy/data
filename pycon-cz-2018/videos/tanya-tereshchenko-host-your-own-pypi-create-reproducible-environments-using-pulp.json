  "description": "Even though software changes constantly under our feet, sometimes we want to keep an old version of a package or organize the packages we want to distribute in a certain way. Reproducible results require reproducible environments so it is important to take matters into your hands.\n\nPulp enables large and small organizations to fetch, upload, organize and distribute software packages in a consistent manner.\n\nIn this session, we will focus on how to manage Python packages with Pulp. We will go over use cases like:\n\nmirroring PyPI content\nmanaging a carefully curated set of packages\npromoting packages through your software development lifecycle\npublish immutable snapshots, and rollback when things go wrong.\nStop by and share your use cases and experiences after the talk.",
