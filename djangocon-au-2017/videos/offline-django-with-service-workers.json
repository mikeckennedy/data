  "description": "So you wish your Django application would work in the most remote places, even when no Internet is available? With service workers, that's possible. They extend browser caching to all requests, including the initial HTML request. When offline, your users can access a fully functioning web application instead of landing on the \"You are offline\" page.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\n* What service workers are\n* How to initialise and manage them\n* What caching strategies to use\n* How to integrate service workers with Django\n\n",
