  "description": "This talk was presented at PyBay2019 - 4th annual Bay Area Regional Python conference. See pybay.com for more details about PyBay and click SHOW MORE for more information about this talk.\n\nDescription\nDropbox is a heavy user of the mypy type checker, recently passing four million lines of type-annotated Python code, with over half of that added in the last eighteen months. Type checking is helping find bugs, making code easier to under stand, enabling refactors, and is an important aid to our ongoing Python 3 migration.\n\nIn this talk, we discuss how we got there. We\u2019ll talk about what we tried in order to get our engineers to type annotate their code\u2014what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what our engineers had to say about it.\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019ll discuss the performance problems we faced as the size of our checked codebase grew, and the techniques we employed to allow mypy\u2014which is implemented in Python\u2014to efficiently check (faster than a second, for most incremental checks) millions of lines of code, which culminated in mypyc, a new ahead-of-time compiler for type-annotated Python!\n\nAbout the speaker\nMichael is a recovering academic with an unfortunate fondness for indefensible hacks. He works at Dropbox on the mypy and mypyc projects.\n\nSponsor Acknowledgement\nThis and other PyBay2019 videos are via the help of our media partner AlphaVoice (https://www.alphavoice.io/)!\n\n#pybay #pybay2019 #python #python3 #gdb",
