  "description": "As with many people, I was looking for an ORM for ``asyncio`` Python.\n\n| Whilst ``asyncio`` is a great framework for I/O bound applications,\n  there isn't any mature, recommendable ORMs for it.\n| Many attempts to wrap an existing sync Python ORM (such as peewee or\n  sqlAlchemy) by having them run in a separate thread, and then dealing\n  with synchronising between the event loop and threads got abandoned,\n  due to a myriad of problems, including performance, correctness and\n  blocking.\n| Other ORMs were abandoned before they worked, or had so many layers of\n  abstraction that I feared to touch it.\n\n| Then I came across `Tortoise\n  ORM <http://tortoise-orm.readthedocs.io/>`__\n| It had a simple design. (Inspired by the Django ORM syntax)\n| It actually worked when I tried it out.\n\nSo I decided to jump in, and help with development.\n\n| In this talk I'll talk about my experience of being on a development\n  team on an ORM.\n| There is a reason there are so few successful ORM projects out there.\n\nDeveloping good ORMs are **HARD**\n",
