  "description": "People live with mental health stigma because we learn that we're\nsupposed to be strong and resilient. It's okay not to be strong or\nresilient all the time. Discussing mental illness is uncomfortable. In\nthis talk, I will help you overcome that discomfort by examining the\nmost common mental health issues, how you can get help for yourself, and\nhow you can best support your coworkers, friends, and family. No one\nshould have to deal with mental illness alone. Bring your tissues.\n",
