  "description": "At the end of 2017, there were seven states with ongoing redistricting litigation.  We will discuss a statistical model that the United States Supreme Court declared to be appropriate in cases of racial gerrymandering, and show how it can be implemented and used with the library `PyMC3`.  We will also discuss what the model tells us about racial gerrymandering in North Carolina.",
