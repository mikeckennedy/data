  "description": "When you are writing code, you have a very clear target: that the code will run and that the output will be accurate. But have you ever stopped and thought about the language in which you are writing?\n\nThe lecture will deal with topics that programmers usually don't talk about: evaluation order, the variables environment, what happens behind the scenes, and in general - the meaning of every line of the code.",
