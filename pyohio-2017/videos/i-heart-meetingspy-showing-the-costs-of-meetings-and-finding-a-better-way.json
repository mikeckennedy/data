  "description": "We've all sat through boring/wasteful meetings. I wanted to find a solution. So I made a Python app that connects with the Google Calendar API, gets all the events in a period and posts the costs of each event to Slack. A following poll asks if it was worth the costs. I would like to describe how it was made and how we can make meetings valuable and engaging, instead of boring wastes of time.",
