  "abstract": "This tutorial will introduce the basics of network theory and working\nwith graphs/networks using python and the NetworkX package. This will be\na hands on tutorial and will require writing a lot of code snippets. The\nparticipants should be comfortable with basic python (loops,\ndictionaries, lists) and some(minimal) experience with working inside a\njupyter notebook.\n\nBroadly the tutorial is divided into four parts:\n\nPart A (20 mins) - Basics of graph theory, NetworkX and various examples\nof networks in real life.\n\nPart B (35 mins) - Study the Game of Thrones network and find important\ncharacters and communities in the network.\n\nPart C (35 mins) - Analyze the structure of the US Airport dataset and\nlook at the temporal evolution of the network from 1990 to 2015.\n\nBy the end of the tutorial everyone should be comfortable with hacking\non the NetworkX API, modelling data as networks and basic analysis on\nnetworks using python.\n\nThe tutorial and the datasets will be uploaded on github before the\ntutorial.\n",

  "description": "Network Science deals with modeling and analyzing networks. Politics,\nmathematics, law, computer science, finance data can be modeled as\nnetworks and in this tutorial will introduce the basic of network theory\nusing the pydata ecosystem(NetworkX, Pandas, matplotlib) and we will use\na Game of Thrones character network and the US Airport dataset to look\nat some real world network data.\n",
