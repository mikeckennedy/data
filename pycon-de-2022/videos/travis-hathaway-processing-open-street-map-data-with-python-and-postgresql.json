    "description": "Speaker:: Travis Hathaway\n\nTrack: PyData: Data Handling\nThe Open Street Map (OSM) project is a global, open-source database with over 50GB of data, and this number grows everyday with every user submission. With such a big data set out there, also comes a huge potential for analysis and use in scientific studies. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will learn how to get started with your own analysis using PostgreSQL as the data store and Python as the data processing language. To help you see exactly how this works, I first introduce the OSM data types, explain how to import this data into PostgreSQL and then cover how you can organise a Python project for data analysis.\r\n\r\nI end the talk by going over an example project, and there will also be plenty of links and resources for those wishing to learn even more.\n\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.\nhttps://2022.pycon.de\nMore details at the conference page: https://2022.pycon.de/program/AKCLEP\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pyconde",
