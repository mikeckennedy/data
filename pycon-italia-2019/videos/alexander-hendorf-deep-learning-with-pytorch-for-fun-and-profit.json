  "description": "There are all these great articles and blog posts about Deep Learning\ndescribing all that awesome stuff. - Is it all that easy? Let\u2019s check!\n\nWe\u2019ll look into: style transfer (making a picture look like painting),\nspeech generation (like Siri or Alexa) and text generation (writing a\nstory). In this talk I\u2019ll describe the whole journey: A fun ride from\nthe idea to the very end including all the struggles, failures and\nsuccesses.\n\nThis is an ongoing talk on how far we can get creating a full `radio\ndrama (H\u00f6rspiel) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_drama>`__ with\ndeep learning and the resources required.\n\nSteps, we\u2019ll cover:\n\n-  The data challenge: get the data ready\n-  Creating a character-level language models with an Recurrent Neural\n   Network\n-  Creating a text generator\n-  Creating artwork\n-  Synthesising speech\n-  Making it sound like a real person\n\nIn this special PyCon X edition we will also try to recreate text in the\nstyle of Dante\u2019 Divina Commedia.\n\n**Feedback form:** https://python.it/feedback-1687\n\nin \\_\\_on **Friday 3 May** at 12:00 `**See\nschedule** </en/sprints/schedule/pycon10/>`__\n",
