  "description": "This talk will illustrate common patterns for writing efficient process pipelines with the subprocess module; automatically checking for errors in those pipelines; and catching those errors and reporting them to the user in a standard way by defining a custom excepthook.  Used together, they'll give your script behavior more like a polished command line tool, without any serious rearchitecting.  Each of these patterns is straightforward and has no dependencies outside Python's standard library, so they're easy to use in both new and existing scripts.",
