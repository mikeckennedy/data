  "description": "Building the Wave Robots API: Behind the Scenes\n\nPresented by Pamela S Fox (Google)\n\nThe Google Wave robots protocol involves JSON-RPC messages that are sent\nbetween the Wave server and the robot, communicating events to process\nand operations to perform. The Python Robots API abstracts on top of\nthat JSON-RPC service, allowing developers to interact with waves using\nevent callbacks, python classes, and chained functions. In this talk,\nwe'll explain the JSON- RPC protocol, talk about how we designed the API\nto sit on top of that protocol, and show how developers can use the API.\n",
