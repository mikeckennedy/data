  "description": "Talk: Into the Rabbit Hole\n\nDjango is awesome when it comes to speeding up a development process. The famous Django\u2019s magic will let you develop quickly and easily. But there are times, when Django's magic is gone and you end up in a rabbit hole, chasing a rabbit instead of stoping as soon as possible and find your way out.The talk will be a case study of how one can end up in rabbit hole. We will see how easy it is to end up digging in Django Model Forms, instead of looking at the problem objectively.The talk goal is to start a discussion about techniques that help you realize that you are going in a wrong direction and you should go back one or two steps as soon as possible.\n\nSpeaker: Ola Sendecka. Python & Django enthusiast and magic maker. Co-founder of Django Girls, Django Core developer and DSF member. Serial Django Girls coach and Django sprint organizer. Co-organizer of Django Con (Circus edition) in 2013.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/asendecka/into-the-rabbit-hole\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
