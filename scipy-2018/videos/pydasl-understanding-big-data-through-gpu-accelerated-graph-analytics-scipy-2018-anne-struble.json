  "description": "Our worlds are full of massive amounts of complexly connected data.\nGraph analytics offer a solution for extracting meaning from the mass.\nApplied examples include: discovering malicious exfiltrators in networks\nwith millions of connections, or finding optimal drug targets in\nelaborate chemical pathways. Multiple low-level GPU-accelerated graph\nframeworks exist, but a steep learning curve has prevented widespread\nuse of iterative graph analytics by the data science community. This\nsession will focus on PyDASL, a Python tool capable of performing GPU\naccelerated graph operations. PyDASL enables developers to quickly\nauthor iterative graph analytics with up to 9,000% less code than other\ncomparably performing GPU-accelerated graph frameworks. We will show the\nease of writing and executing a new graph analytic and review PyDASL\u2019s\nbuilt-in analytics.Presenter(s): Speaker: Anne Struble, Systap Speaker:\nBrad Bebee, Systap\n",
