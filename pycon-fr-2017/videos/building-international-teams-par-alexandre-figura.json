  "description": "Building a successful team is not that easy. But when your members come from countries all over the globe, it starts to become really challenging! We can all speak in English, we still have different cultures and different mindsets. However, this diversity turns out to be the greatest strength of international teams. To understand why, we need to look back in history, to travel through the ages, and see where our modern civilizations come from. At the end of our journey, we will discover what makes these teams so polyvalent, and why they can be an example for all of us.",
