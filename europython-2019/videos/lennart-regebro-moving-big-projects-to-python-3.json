  "description": "Next year Python 2 is no longer maintained. But you have a monster code\nbase with clever tricks and libraries that don't support Python 2, and\nyour data may be stored in a format that is hard to move Python 3. And\nthat's the easy bit.\n\nThis talk focuses on the process of moving, not the code changes.\nBecause it's the process that is the hard part. How do you get your code\nin a state where it's ready to move? How do you get the whole team on\nthe boat to Python 3?\n\nAll Python 3 talks I have seen, including those I have given, and all\nthe texts on how to port, including the book I wrote, focus on the code\nchanges. With increasing backwards compatibility in Python 3 and\nforward-compatibility in Python 2, this actually became a lesser problem\nfor big code bases.\n\n-  The extra issues of large, old code bases\n-  Can you stop adding features? (1 min)\n-  Separate team vs getting everyone on it (2 min)\n-  Python 2 compatibility: You need it (1 min)\n-  The steps\n-  Fix your development process (2 min)\n-  Replace old libraries, or take over maintenance and port them (2 min)\n-  Make sure your tests are solid (1 min)\n-  Run 2to3 but only backwards compatible fixers (2 min)\n-  Run tests on Python 3 to stop backsliding (4 min)\n-  Run all tests: Expansive or slow\n-  Store passed tests\n-  Detect tests that change\n-  Turning it off adds a lot of extra work\n-  Port all your little utilities and tool scripts (1 min)\n-  Fix fix fix fix (1 min)\n-  Add tests with Python 2 data, to test migration (2 min)\n-  You might need migration scripts\n-  Extra careful staging tests (1 min)\n-  Production: Try, fail, repeat (1 min)\n-  Clean the code up (3 min)",
