  "description": "Few people realize just how complicated text can be. Did you know\nsorting and even case-folding can depend on a user's locale? That\ndifferent strings of characters can be semantically completely\nequivalent? That there are over a thousand Latin letters?\n\nLegacy text encodings like ASCII made a lot of simplifying assumptions\nabout how written languages work, and we all put up with them because it\nwas cool to even have computers in the first place. Unicode removes many\nof those assumptions and provides the tools we need to write software\nthat can just do the right thing regardless of what text users throw at\nit. Even if you don't translate your UI, getting the details of string\ncomparison, sorting, and searching right can eliminate annoying\nsurprises for you and your users.\n",
