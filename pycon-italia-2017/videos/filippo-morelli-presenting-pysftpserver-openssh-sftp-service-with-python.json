  "description": "Have you ever needed to connect to an OpenSSH SFTP server and keep track\nof the user activities? Or maybe limit user permissions? Or define\nspecific callbacks to react to user actions?\n\n*pysftpserver* is an OpenSSH SFTP wrapper, written purely in Python. It\nis yet another cool example of what you might already know: how powerful\nPython can be while staying extremely simple.\n\nThis talk aims at presenting the tool and a few use cases in which it\nwas harnessed, including one with Django and Django REST Framework. It\nrequires a good knowledge of Python and Django and understanding the\nbasics of a SFTP service.\n",
