  "description": "Developing distributed systems is hard. Implementing distributed system\nfrom scratch requires knowledge of specialized algorithms and\nprogramming techniques. Consul is distributed system which enables us to\nbuild distributed system only by using Consul HTTP API. In our\npresentation, we are going to show basic concepts of consul, building\nour own consul cluster and showing how consul can be used for\nimplementing distributed system. Our discussion will include also\nshowing how we can benefit from consul even when using already existing\npython distributed components.\n",
