  "description": "Python is well-known as a programming language without static types. This\nmeans that you don't need to say what a given variable will hold, or whether\nyour function will return a string or an integer (or sometimes one, and\nsometimes another!). This has historically made Python a very flexible and\nbeginner-friendly language.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the advantages and disadvantages to a static\ntype system, as well as recent efforts to introduce static typing to Python\nvia optional \"type hints\" and various tools to aid in adding types to Python\ncode. We'll see what this means for Python, for Python programmers, and what\nthe future has in store for Python's type system.",
