  "description": "\"What You Need To Know About Python Debugging\" by: Philip Bauer\nNobody writes flawless code. Understanding and fixing the cause of errors is a large part of our daily lives as developers. Reading tracebacks, adding print-statements and taking educated guesses are just the beginning: Python has a multitude of tools and techniques and knowing how to apply them make you more productive and will boost the understanding of the code you\u2019re otherwise banging your head against.\n\nIn this tutorial you will learn how to get the most out of various debugging-tools and -approaches. You will deal with logging, tracebacks, interactive debugging, introspection and other topics and will apply each tool and technique in exercises to get familiar with it.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
