  "description": "In 2012 not a lot of people were interested in Python in the\nrelatively small city of Tirana, the capital of Albania. Even fewer\ngirls were interested in Python. During our talk we will share the\nstory of how we, a small but dedicated group of people, jump started\nthe community in a small country like Albania and what other small\ncities and countries should avoid during their first steps in\ndeveloping a Python community in similar conditions.\n\nMost important we will share tips and tricks on how to keep the\nPython spirit alive for a long time after the first enthusiastic\nsteps, with the goal that our shared experience will help other\ncommunities to make the first steps or grow even further. Also\nnowadays we are witnessing that the number of girls involved in\ntechnical fields, especially development, is really low and we are\ngoing to present what as the influence on low participation of girls\nand the steps we should take to fix it.",
