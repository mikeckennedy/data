  "description": "In 2017 there is structured data everywhere, and new data sources emerge\neach day. There are lots of Python tools for processing this data:\nAnalytics, statistics, visualization, natural language processing,\nmachine learning, etc. But recent experiments have demonstrated that\nthere are untapped opportunities for innovation in new methods of\nproviding users quick access to these disparate data sources,\ntransforming that data, and streaming it into the wealth of existing\nPython tools. This talk will discuss some of those opportunities and\ndemonstrate related, lesser-known, yet valuable community- based Python\ntools that have just recently emerged and are now available for free.",
