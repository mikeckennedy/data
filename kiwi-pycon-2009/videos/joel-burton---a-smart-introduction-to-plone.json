  "description": "A smart introduction to Plone\n\nPresented by Joel Burton\n\nAbstract\n\nThe world of online content management systems has become so enormous\nthat it can be difficult to weigh the advantages--and disadvantages--of\nthe systems. The speaker, a noted Plone author and consultant, will\ndemonstrate the featureset of Plone, and provide real-world hints on the\ncustomer value and challenges it provides.\n\nOutline\n\nHere, you can learn where Plone may serve your needs well, and where it\nmight be overkill or inappropriately deployed. You'll also learn\napproximate budgets, in time and learning, you'd need to get up to speed\non the system. In addition, a demonstration of the upcoming features of\nPlone 4 and a future- looking glance at the radically-redesigned Plone 5\nwill be given. Recommended for new and casual users of Plone, and for\npeople interested in understanding its niche in the CMS/application\ndevelopment world.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.
