  "description": "`Cloud Foundry <http://cloudfoundry.org/>`__ is an open source\nPlatform-as-a- Service that can be used to easily deliver data driven\napplications. In this tutorial we will learn how to push an application\nto a real CF instance, how to connect to managed data services like\nRedis and PostgreSQL and how to deploy PyData and R projects using\ncommunity buildpacks.\n\nBy the end of the tutorial participants will know how to \\_ deploy your\nfirst app using Cloud Foundry, \\_ connect to databases and other data\nservices, \\_ use PyData packages with a Heroku-style buildpack, \\_ find\npublic and private Cloud Foundry installation options.\n\nParticipants will need to register on a public Cloud Foundry instance to\nfollow along with the tutorial. Detailed instructions will be provided\nfor `Pivotal Web Services <http://run.pivotal.io/>`__ which offers a 60\nday free trial. Other options include IBM Bluemix and HP Helion\nDevelopment Platform.\n\nParticipants should be comfortable on the command line and download and\ninstall the `CF CLI\ntools <http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/install-go-cli.html>`__\nbefore the tutorial.\n",
