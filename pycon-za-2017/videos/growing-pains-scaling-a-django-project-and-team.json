  "description": "In this talk I\u2019ll describe the evolution of a Django project as it\ngoes from something small and simple to a full-blown multi-server,\nmulti-datacenter behemoth. The talk will use examples from real-world\napplications I\u2019ve either built or contributed do, and draw heavily\nfrom my experience leading the development of `CommCare HQ\n<https://www.commcarehq.org/>`__ (an 8-year old, ~500,000 LoC\ncodebase currently developed and maintained by about 20 people).\n\nThe goal of the talk is to try and demonstrate how and why complexity\nand process seeps into projects over time and is in fact necessary as a\nproject\u2019s lifecycle matures. I'll base the talk around a series of\nexamples that highlight a problem and then discuss how the introduction\nof a new subsystem, architecture, or process helps to address that\nproblem. These problems / solutions will be a mix of the technical (e.g.\n\"the site is slow\") and human (e.g. \"we can't ship features quickly\nanymore\").\n\nAnyone who is part of a growing project or team should hopefully learn\nsomething or get some ideas for what might be in store for your future!\n",
