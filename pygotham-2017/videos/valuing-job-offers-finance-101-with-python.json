  "description": "How do we value job offers? If one firm offers X and another Y, the matter may be straightforward if everything else is equal. But that is rarely the case.\n\nHow do we value options? How do we deal with the uncertainty of vesting and company performance? Should we value perks? \n\nThis talk will present introductory financial theory, with pure Python functions first, and the objects delegating calculations to Numpy, to answer these questions.\n\nThe speaker has an MBA, works in finance, has taught Python at Columbia and NYU, and is a former business professor and financial advisor.",
