  "description": "Web development is a complexity challenge nowadays. Growing number of\nfunctionalities results in customer expectations increase which makes\nproject design more difficult. Using proper tools that suite your\ncustomer needs is essential.\n\nIn this talk I would like to present two successful stories using\nclosely together Pyramid and Plone. Basing on these examples I wished to\nhighlight the main reasons for using Plone as a CMS only and letting\nPyramid do the rest (vertical application). Moreover, I will underscore\ngood and bad practices during integration process and how to make\nfarsighted architectural decisions in a right moment.\n\nPrerequisites: be familiarized with common python web framework\nconcepts.\n",
