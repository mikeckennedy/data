  "description": "The rapidly growing size of data has broadened the role of data\nscientists. Instead of creating models for one-off analysis, it's\nbecoming common to use prototypes in real-world applications. Spotify\nLuigi helps to enable such scenarios, without having to learn a whole\nbunch of new technologies. We will explore Luigi's concepts and learn\nhow to code solutions for common problems in data pipelines.\n",
