  "description": "\"Python 1994\" by: Paul Everitt\n\n\u201cCome for the language, stay for the community.\u201d The Python community started in 1994 at a NIST workshop in Maryland. What was the world of Python like in its first years? Did we have any clue whatsoever? A joke-focused tour of early Python, heavy on question-and-answer.\n\nRecorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (https://2021.pythonwebconf.com)",
