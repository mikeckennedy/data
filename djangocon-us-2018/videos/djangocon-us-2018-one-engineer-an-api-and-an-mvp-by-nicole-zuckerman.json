  "description": "The fact that tech is struggling to hire or retain employees from\ndiverse backgrounds has been written about and discussed thoroughly,\nparticularly in the last few years. The economic, societal, and moral\nbenefits of diversity are also well documented. Why is it hard, then,\nfor well-intentioned organizations to shift their demographics? There\nare a number of reasons, but one that doesn\u2019t appear to have been\nthoroughly discussed already is the challenge of gathering and\nresponding to data about diversity within a company\u2019s hiring pool and\nexisting employees. One hack day, I was involved in too many projects\nand had only a token amount of time to devote to the one I was most\ninterested in; seeing if we could determine whether we had sufficient\ndiversity for any given role to start interviewing candidates, or if we\nneeded to spend more efforts sourcing diverse candidates for the pool. I\naccomplished an MVP in approximately an hour, once I had an api key and\npermissions. It doesn\u2019t necessarily require a huge effort to make a big\ndifference.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll walk through the MVP indicating, for each role,\nwhether there was \u201csufficient diversity\u201d. I\u2019ll also address gotchas,\nlimitations, and What Now.\n",
