  "description": "This talk will demonstrate an example application of using Celery to\nextract all of the lyrics of the inspiring and influential Taylor\nSwift from the Internet. Using a light-hearted approach and practical\nPython examples, we aim to teach people the basics of using Celery for\ndata extraction.\n\nCelery is an open source, Python-based, asynchronous task framework\nwhich is well-suited for extracting data from webpages, APIs, and text\nfiles. With its power comes a bit of a learning curve. This talk\ncovers some of the first questions a new Celery user might have. It\nwill also point out some common pitfalls for beginning users.",
