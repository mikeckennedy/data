  "description": "Scrapy itself is a good example of modern asynchronous application. Moreover it's a swiss army knife with all kinds of extensions: Item pipelines, HTML/CSS selectors, Middlewares. In this talk, I\u2019m going to explain how the Scrapy\u2019s internal processing pipeline works, the design of it\u2019s downloader queue and all the things needed to debug it: Scrapy shell, telnet console, memory consumption debugging.\n\nScrapy is a 100% asynchronous web scraping framework built with Twisted event loop with 21K GitHub stars!\n",
