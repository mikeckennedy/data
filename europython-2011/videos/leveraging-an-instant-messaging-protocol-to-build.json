  "description": "XMPP is an open technology for real-time communication. Although\nprimarily known for its application in the IM service \"Jabber\" (and,\nsubsequently, gchat/gtalk), it has numerous applications and creates new\nopportunities for inter-system communication.\n\nWhile researching for an alternative to webservices at Mendix, we came\nacross XMPP and realized it solved many of the shortcomings of\nwebservices. It is currently being used to handle all inter-system and\ninter-process communication in the Mendix cloud hosting environment.\n\nThe talk will give a general overview of what XMPP is, an introduction\nto the sleekxmpp python library and how the core features of xmpp can\nhelp an architecture scale well horizontally.\n\nRequired knowledge: basic understanding of hosting environments.\n",
